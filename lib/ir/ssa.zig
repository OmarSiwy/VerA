//! Class 4 — SSA construction (Braun et al., "Simple and Efficient Construction
//! of Static Single Assignment Form"). Serves LRM §5 control flow: §5.8
//! conditionals, §5.9 loops, variable reads/writes across blocks.
//!
//! Transformation: per-block writes/reads → SSA Values with phi nodes.
//!
//! DOD:
//!   - defs: DENSE matrix (place, block) → Value. It was a sparse hash map on the
//!     theory that most pairs are undefined; measured, they are not (19% of cells
//!     live on hisimhv_va, ~100% on small modules) and the hash table was the
//!     single hottest thing in the frontend. See `SsaBuilder.defs`.
//!   - per-block state (sealed?, preds, incomplete phis) in a MultiArrayList row
//!     indexed by Block; the pred and incomplete-phi lists are intrusive u32
//!     indices into two flat pools, not one allocation per block.
//!   - trivial-phi removal aliases a phi to its single value (Mir.alias, so
//!     codegen never emits a `var` for it).
//!
//! CONTRACT FOR CONSUMERS (proof.zig, codegen.zig):
//!   1. Every Value read out of the MIR MUST be passed through `mir.resolveAlias`
//!      before use. A collapsed phi is never rewritten in its users' operand
//!      lists — the alias table IS the rewrite. `resolveAlias(v) != v` means the
//!      phi is dead: emit no declaration for it.
//!   2. Phi instructions are created ON DEMAND, so a `.phi` row can sit anywhere
//!      in its block's instruction chain — including after the terminator.
//!      Codegen must treat `.phi` as a block header: skip it in the linear walk
//!      and materialize it as a mutable local assigned at the end of each
//!      predecessor (the standard SSA-out-of-form move). Never emit a phi row
//!      in place.

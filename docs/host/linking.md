# Shared libraries, validation and GPUs

There are two ways to put a VerA device into a simulator.

- **As a module.** Generate `device.zig` (`vera --emit-zig model.va -o
  device.zig`) and compile it into your own Zig program, as the
  [minimal host](minimal-host.md) does. The device is then ordinary source in
  your build: inlined, specialised to your family, and checked against your
  host at compile time.
- **As a shared library.** `vera --emit-so` compiles the device together with
  a small module of yours, the `dyn` module, into a `.so` (`.dll`, `.dylib`)
  your simulator loads at run time. Whatever the `dyn` module exports is the
  library's interface, so a host in any language can call it through the C
  ABI.

## `--emit-so` and the `dyn` module

```sh
vera --emit-so --dyn dyn.zig --work-dir build model.va
```

VerA writes the device and a generated *shim* under `build/`, then compiles
them with your `dyn.zig` and the `contract` module. Apart from forwarding
your `vera_validate_contract` (below), the shim is:

```zig
comptime {
    @import("dyn").exportDevice(@import("device"), "<name>");
}
```

So `dyn.zig` declares

```zig
pub fn exportDevice(comptime D: type, comptime name: []const u8) void
```

and `@export`s whatever functions your simulator calls, instantiated for
`D`. A complete one, exporting the residual and dense Jacobian at a point:

```zig
{{#include ../examples/host/dyn.zig}}
```

and a program that loads the library and calls it:

```zig
{{#include ../examples/host/load.zig}}
```

```console
{{#include ../examples/host/so.out}}
```

`load.zig` passes the operating point the minimal host solved, rounded to a
microvolt. Each row is the current leaving that node into the device: at
the anode +367.2 µA, the series resistor's (0.632872 − 0.629200) V / 10 Ω;
at the cathode −367.1 µA, the junction current, negative because it flows
out of the device into `k`. The internal node's row would be exactly zero at the
unrounded solution; here it is −76 nA, the 0.114 S of `df[ai]/dx[ai]` (the
series 0.1 S plus the junction's I/V<sub>T</sub>) times the rounding.

`--emit-so` prints the library's path: `<work-dir>/lib<name>.<generation>.so`
(the platform's prefix and suffix). The command line always builds
generation 1; a host that embeds VerA as a library (`vera.buildArtifact`)
passes its own generation per rebuild, so each rebuild is a fresh file and a
fresh inode to `dlopen`. The build is ReleaseFast with the LLVM backend by
default (`--optimize`, `--zig-backend`, `--debug-info` change that).

`tests/arpice_dyn.zig` is a real `dyn` module: it exports one `evalQ` over
the sparse reference family with every operand from the caller.
`tests/vdev_dyn.zig` exports a digital device's transient as one C call. The
CI job `arpice-consumer` builds ARPice ([OmarSiwy/ESPice](https://github.com/OmarSiwy/ESPice))
against every VerA commit, compiling its model corpus through its own `dyn`.

### Large devices

A device past a size threshold is built as one object per part, in parallel,
then linked (`contract.DevicePart`: `.setup`, `.state`, `.eval`). A `dyn`
module may declare

```zig
pub fn exportDevicePart(comptime D: type, comptime name: []const u8, comptime part: contract.DevicePart) void
```

beside `exportDevice`; the split build calls it once per part, and it must
export each symbol from exactly one part. Without it, `exportDevice` runs in
the setup object. A large `setup` comes in chunks (`D.setup_chunks`); a `dyn`
that also declares `pub fn SetupValue(comptime D: type) type`, the value
scalar it passes `setup`, gets each chunk compiled in its own object.

## Validation

The contract can check a device and a host at compile time. The checks are
**opt-in**: they run only where the program's root module declares

```zig
pub const vera_validate_contract = true;
```

(`contract.validating`). For an `--emit-so` build, declare it in the `dyn`
module; the shim forwards it. The minimal host and the `dyn.zig` above both
opt in. The contract's header records their cost at 0.4-1.8% of a device
build's instructions (measured 2026-10-01).

With the checks on:

- `contract.validate(D)` (called inside every generated device) checks every
  declaration's shape and the tables' invariants, and refuses an unknown
  public declaration.
- `contract.validateHost(H, D)`, which your host calls once per device,
  checks the obligations the device puts on the host. `H` declares each one
  it meets as a `true` constant:

| Declaration on `H` | Needed when the device has | Promise |
|---|---|---|
| `calls_setup` | `setup` or `setupInstance` | you call `setup` per `Model` row after `derive` and after every card, `temperature__` or `setup_simparams` write, then `setupInstance` per instance, before `eval` |
| `mutable_eval` | `mutable_eval` | each evaluation gets exclusive `*Instance` |
| `iteration_hooks` | `advanceIteration` or `checkConvergence` | you call the first after every iterate and the second before accepting one |
| `noise_table_points` | `noiseTablePoints` | you read the card's noise-table knots, through `contract.noiseTable` (the row's `noise_table_points__`) or the hook |
| `shape_check` | `checkShape` | you call it after `derive` and refuse a card it names |
| `calls_ac_dyn` | `ac_dyn_slots` | `true`: every small-signal matrix adds `acDyn`; `false`: you run no small-signal analysis |
| `systf` | a non-empty `systf_calls` | `fn (*const Model) ?*const SystfHost`, binding the VPI application |

One check runs whether or not you opt in: `validateHost` refuses a device
whose `contract_abi` differs from `contract.abi_version`, with "regenerate
it with the VerA this contract came from". `--contract PATH` builds against
another contract file; by default VerA uses the copy built into it, so the
contract always matches the compiler.

## GPUs

The generated device imports only `std` and `contract`, calls no OS, and
reaches transcendental functions only through `contract.gm`: VerA's own
`exp`, `log` and `pow` (one implementation on every target, faithful to under
1 ulp) and GPU forms of `tanh`, `sinh`, `cosh`, `sin`, `cos`, `expm1` and
`atan`, since NVPTX and AMDGCN have no libm. On the host those are the Zig
builtins or `std.math`, so a GPU result may differ slightly from the CPU's
(`gm`'s comments say what each GPU form is and how far it may differ;
`exp`, `log` and `pow` are the same bits everywhere). `RefFamily` computes through
`gm` too. So the same `device.zig` compiles for `nvptx64-cuda` and
`amdgcn-amdhsa` with the LLVM backend.

`tests/status_gpu.zig` is the pattern: a `callconv(.kernel)` export that
runs `evalQ` and `updateState` over a dense `RefFamily`
(`tests/say_gpu.zig` does the same for `say`). `zig build test` compiles both
for `nvptx64-cuda` (`sm_70`, to LLVM IR, because the NVPTX backend refuses
the alias `@export` of a kernel makes; a host rewrites the IR) and for
`amdgcn-amdhsa` (`gfx906`, to an object). No GPU runs them in CI.

What is not covered: only the math functions device code is known to reach
are ported (`gm`'s header says so); a model that reaches another builtin on a
GPU target fails its kernel compile, and `gm` is where to add it. The
reference family's `log1p` calls `std.math.log1p` directly rather than a
`gm` function; whether that compiles for both GPU targets is not covered by
those two kernels.

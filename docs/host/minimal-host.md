# A minimal host

This page builds the smallest useful simulator around a VerA device: a Zig
program that solves one DC operating point by Newton's method. Everything
else in this part of the book adds to this loop.

## The circuit

A 1 V source drives a diode through a 1 kΩ resistor. The resistor and the
source belong to the host; the diode is a Verilog-A model with its own series
resistance, so it has an internal node:

```text
1 V --[ R = 1 kΩ ]-- a --[ rs = 10 Ω ]-- ai --[ junction ]-- k = ground
                     \_____________ diode.va _____________/
```

```verilog
{{#include ../examples/host/diode.va}}
```

The device's unknowns are its two ports and its internal node,
`U = { a, k, ai }`. The host grounds `k` and solves for `a` and `ai`.

## The host

```zig
{{#include ../examples/host/host.zig}}
```

Step by step:

- **Opting in.** `vera_validate_contract` turns on the contract's
  conformance checks for this program, and `contract.validateHost` checks at
  compile time that the host meets what this device needs: here only
  `calls_setup`, because the device has a `setup`. Leave the declaration out
  and the build fails with an error saying so.
- **The families.** `S` is the dense reference family with one derivative
  lane per unknown: every value `eval` computes carries its partial with
  respect to `a`, `k` and `ai`. `Val` has no lanes; the card-time hooks take
  it. [Scalar families](families.md) explains both.
- **The card.** `Model` holds every parameter at its default. The host runs
  `derive` (when the device has one), `setup`, which fills `model.su` with
  the values that depend only on the card and its temperature, and
  `setupInstance` (when declared), in that order. Both card-time hooks take
  the family itself, `Val`, not a value type.
- **One evaluation per iterate.** `D.eval` returns one row per unknown: its
  value is the current leaving that node through the device, and its lanes
  are that row of the Jacobian. With a dense family every row has the same
  type, so the result coerces to an array.
- **Constant columns.** An unknown outside `deriv_reads` carries no lane;
  its partials are compile-time constants in `jac_const`. This diode has
  none, but the loop is what a general host needs.
- **The host's own stamp.** The 1 kΩ resistor adds its current
  `(V(a) − 1 V)/R` to row `a` and its conductance to the diagonal.
- **Newton.** Solve `J·dx = −f` for the two free unknowns (Cramer's rule is
  enough for two) and stop when the step is below 1 pV.

## Running it

The host compiles against two modules: the generated device, and the
contract. `contract.zig` is installed as `share/vera/contract.zig` by `zig
build install`; in the repository it is `tools/contract.zig`, which the
command below uses. `zig run` binds modules with `--dep` (which applies to the
next `-M`) and `-M` (the first one is the root):

```console
{{#include ../examples/host/host.out}}
```

W0650 is VerA reporting that it cannot prove the exponential finite for
every input, so the junction compiles in strict float mode
([Diagnostics](../using/diagnostics.md)); `--allow=W0650` keeps it out of the
transcript.

From the starting guess of 0.6 V, Newton takes seven iterates. Over the last
three the residual goes from about 1e-7 to 1e-11 to 7e-19 A: the number of
correct digits roughly doubles each time, which is Newton's quadratic
convergence with an exact Jacobian.

## Checking the answer

The same circuit by hand: the junction voltage V<sub>d</sub> = V(ai) and
the current I satisfy

```text
I = is · (exp(Vd / (n · Vt)) − 1)          (the junction)
I = (1 V − Vd) / (R + rs)                  (the two resistors in series)
Vt = k·T/q = 8.617333262145179e-5 · 300.15 = 0.0258649 V
```

with `is` = 10 fA, `n` = 1, R + rs = 1010 Ω. Solving the two by bisection
(independently of VerA, in a few lines of Python) gives
V<sub>d</sub> = 0.629200 V and I = 367.128 µA, so
V(a) = V<sub>d</sub> + I · rs = 0.632872 V: the host's last line.

## What this host leaves out

It is one DC point of one memoryless device with no limiting. The rest of
this part adds, in order of need: charges and the transient loop, device
state, `$limit` and breakpoints ([charges, truncation error and
state](state.md)); noise and AC ([tables](tables.md)); evaluating many
instances per call ([batching](batching.md)); and loading the device from a
shared library instead of compiling it in ([linking](linking.md)).
`src/sim/spice/` in the repository is a complete small host (operating
point, LTE-controlled transient and noise over one device) to read next.

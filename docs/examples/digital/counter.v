// A clock and a 4-bit counter. clk toggles every 5 ns, so it rises at 5, 15,
// 25, ... and falls at 10, 20, 30, ... The counter steps on each rising edge,
// and the display on each falling edge reads the count halfway through the
// cycle: 1 at 10 ns, 2 at 20 ns, ..., 5 at 50 ns. $finish at 60 ns ends the
// run before the 60 ns falling edge prints anything.

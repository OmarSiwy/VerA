# VerA

VerA is a Verilog-AMS compiler. It reads a Verilog-A device model (or a
digital IEEE 1364 design, or a mix of both) and writes **Zig source**: a
device with a residual, an exact Jacobian, charges, noise and state, which a
circuit simulator compiles into its own Newton loop. The same emitted file
builds for a CPU, as a shared library, as a self-checking testbench, or as an
NVPTX or AMDGCN kernel.

This book has four parts.

1. **[Learn Verilog-AMS](learn/getting-started.md)** teaches the language from
   nothing, the way *The Rust Programming Language* teaches Rust: one
   construct per chapter, each with a model you can run, and exercises at the
   end. Every chapter also shows how the same thing looks in VerA.
2. **[Using VerA](using/install.md)** is the reference for the tool: installing
   it, every command-line flag, the `//!` testbench directives, diagnostics,
   the attributes VerA reads, and the choices VerA makes where the standard
   leaves one open.
3. **[VerA devices in your own simulator](host/why.md)** is for simulator
   authors. It documents the device contract, `tools/contract.zig`, and walks
   through a small host that loads a VerA device and solves it.
4. **[Conformance and performance](conformance.md)** gives the measured
   numbers: how much of the standard VerA covers, and how fast it compiles.

## The examples are checked

Every command and every output in this book is real. Each example is a file
under `docs/examples/`, and each transcript shown after it (the lines starting
with `$`, and what follows them) is a `.out` file that CI re-runs with
`tools/doctest.py` on every push. If VerA's output changes, the build fails
until the page is updated. So the output you read is the output the current
VerA prints.

On the published site, an example can also be edited and re-run in the
browser. [Running examples in the browser](using/browser.md) says what that
runs and what it costs.

## The standard

VerA implements the Verilog-AMS Language Reference Manual 2023 (the "LRM"),
and through it IEEE 1364-2005, which the LRM inherits for the digital half.
The book cites clauses as `LRM §5.6.1` and `IEEE 1364-2005 §9.2`. The LRM is
in the repository as per-chapter HTML and PDF under
[`specification/`](https://github.com/OmarSiwy/VerA/tree/main/specification),
together with the clause audit and the record of every reading VerA chose
where the text is vague.

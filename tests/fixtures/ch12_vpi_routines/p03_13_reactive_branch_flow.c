/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.10: the flow of a capacitor's branch in a transient,
 * alone on its node pair and sharing it with another instance's.
 *
 *   12.10   vpi_get_analog_value() "shall retrieve the simulation value of
 *           VPI analog vpiFlow or vpiPotential (node or branch) quantity
 *           objects".
 *   5.6.1.2 a `ddt` term is the reactive part of a contribution; the
 *           branch's flow includes its time derivative.
 *   5.4.2   an unnamed branch is created in the module containing the
 *           contribution, so c1 and c2 each own a (b, gnd) branch, and each
 *           branch's flow is its own instance's contribution.
 *
 * DERIVATION. p03_cap_ramp.va holds V(a, gnd) = V(b, gnd) = 1000 t (ideal
 * sources), with I(p, n) <+ c ddt(V(p, n)) in each capacitor: c0 (1 uF)
 * across a, c1 (1 uF) and c2 (3 uF) across b. Each branch's flow is
 * c dV/dt = c * 1000 at every t > 0:
 *
 *     c0: 1e-3 A    c1: 1e-3 A    c2: 3e-3 A
 *
 * The host integrates by backward Euler (src/vpi/analog.zig), whose
 * difference quotient of a charge linear in t is exact, so these are the
 * values at every accepted point after t = 0, to rounding (1e-12 here). At
 * acbFinalStep t = 5 ms, so V(a, gnd) = 5.
 *
 * WHAT IT CATCHES. A host that drops a flow's reactive half reads 0 for all
 * three; one that reports the summed (b, gnd) row for an instance reads 4e-3
 * for c1 and for c2.
 *
 * stdout: "p03-13: v=5 i0=0.001 i1=0.001 i2=0.003".

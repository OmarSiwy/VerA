/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.31.3 across MORE THAN ONE analysis in one simulator run.
 *
 *   12.31.3  acbInitialStep "Upon acceptance of the first analog solution";
 *            acbFinalStep   "Upon acceptance of the last analog solution";
 *            acbAbsTime     "shall force a solution at that time".
 *   12.33.2  vlog_startup_routines runs "just after the simulator is invoked" —
 *            ONCE, not once per analysis. Everything a plugin arms there has to
 *            survive, or not survive, the analysis boundary on its own terms.
 *
 * "First" and "last" are relative to an ANALYSIS, not to the process: two
 * transients in one run are two first solutions and two last ones. That is the
 * only reading under which a plugin can do anything useful at the start of the
 * second analysis, and it is the one this fixture pins:
 *
 *     acbInitialStep fires exactly 2 times
 *     acbFinalStep   fires exactly 2 times
 *
 * with the TIME BASE RESTARTING at each, which is the observable that
 * distinguishes two analyses from one long one:
 *
 *     at every acbInitialStep: t == 0        and V(out) == 1000*0   == 0
 *     at every acbFinalStep:   t == 2e-3     and V(out) == 1000*2e-3 == 2
 *
 * (p03_ramp_load solves to V(out) = 1000*t exactly; see its header.) A host
 * that carried the clock across the boundary reports t == 2e-3 at the second
 * acbInitialStep and V(out) == 2 there, and fails on the first check it reaches.
 *
 * THE THIRD ASSERTION is the one an application actually depends on and that a
 * count-only test would miss: a callback registered BETWEEN analyses — from
 * inside the first analysis's acbFinalStep, when no analysis is running — must
 * be armed for the next one. An acbAbsTime at 1.5e-3 registered there must fire
 * exactly once, in the second transient, at exactly 1.5e-3, where
 * V(out) == 1.5. Exactly once and not twice, because the first transient is
 * already over when it is armed; and not zero, because the second transient
 * covers 1.5e-3.

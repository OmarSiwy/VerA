/* b7 timing-check violation: VAMS-2023 12.31.4's cbTchkViolation, an ACTION
 * callback.
 *
 * 12.31.4  "Actions are differentiated from features in that actions shall
 *          occur in all VPI-compliant products". "The following
 *          action-related callbacks shall be defined: ... cbTchkViolation
 *          Timing check error occurred". "The only fields in the s_cb_data
 *          structure which need to be setup for simulation action/feature
 *          callbacks are the reason, cb_rtn, and user_data". "For
 *          cbTchkViolation callbacks, the obj field shall be a handle to the
 *          timing check."
 * cbTchkViolation is IEEE 1364-2005 Annex G's 14, as src/vpi/vpi_user.h
 * defines it; the guard below keeps the file building against a header
 * without it.
 *
 * DERIVATION (b7_specify.v's header): u1's $setup(d, posedge clk, 5, notif)
 * sees its data events at 0 (x -> 0) and 3 (0 -> 1) and its reference event
 * at 5 (clk 0 -> 1; clk's x -> 0 at 0 is a negedge, IEEE 1364-2005 15.4).
 * 15.2.1: a violation when "(timecheck time) - limit < (timestamp time) <
 * (timecheck time)", the timestamp the last data event before the
 * timecheck: 5 - 5 = 0 < 3 < 5 is one violation, at t=5, in u1 only (u2's
 * clk2 never rises). So exactly one cbTchkViolation, at t=5, with obj u1's
 * $setup.
 *
 * CENSUS: setup 2, eoc 6 (p02_by_name is a CHECK and an expect_no_error),
 * on_violation 3 at its one call, eos 1: checks=12.

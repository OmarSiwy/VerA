// The design b8_readwrite_inactive.c runs (VAMS-2023 8.5.1). No `//!`

// THE TIMELINE (t in ns): at t=0 both regs are 0. At t=7 the one process
// resumes, does a blocking `b = 8'h11` (an active event) and a nonblocking
// `r <= 8'h42` (a nonblocking assign update event), then ends. $finish at 20.

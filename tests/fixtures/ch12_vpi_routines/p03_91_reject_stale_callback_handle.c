/* P03 REJECT — VAMS-2023 12.34: a removed callback handle is dead, and saying
 * so is part of the routine's contract.
 *
 *   12.34  "The routine shall return a 1 (TRUE) if successful, and a 0 (FALSE)
 *          on a failure. After vpi_remove_cb() is called with a handle to the
 *          callback, the handle is no longer valid."
 *   12.6   vpi_get_cb_info() "shall return information about a simulation-
 *          related callback", i.e. about a LIVE one.
 *   12.2   "The error status shall be reset by any VPI routine call except
 *          vpi_chk_error()" — so each failure below is checked immediately, and
 *          each is required to carry a state, a code and a message.
 *
 * FOUR WAYS TO CALL vpi_remove_cb() WRONG, each with its exact return:
 *
 *   remove a live callback      -> 1   (the control, without which a
 *                                       return-0-always implementation passes)
 *   remove the same handle again-> 0 + vpiError
 *   remove NULL                 -> 0 + vpiError
 *   remove a non-callback object-> 0 + vpiError   (a module handle: 12.34 takes
 *                                       "a handle to the callback object", and
 *                                       a handle that is valid but of the wrong
 *                                       class is the case a type check exists
 *                                       for)
 *
 * plus vpi_get_cb_info() on the removed handle, which must report rather than
 * follow a freed pointer. Three of these hand the implementation a pointer it
 * once owned or never owned; all four have to survive it, because "no longer
 * valid" is a promise to the APPLICATION and an application that keeps a stale
 * handle is the reason the sentence is in the standard.
 *
 * The last assertion is the behavioural one: the removed callback was an
 * acbFinalStep, the run has exactly one final analog solution, and the routine
 * must be invoked ZERO times. A removal that returns 1 and then dispatches
 * anyway is the failure this catches, and it is invisible to every check above.

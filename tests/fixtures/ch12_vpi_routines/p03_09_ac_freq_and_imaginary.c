/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.8 and 12.10: the small-signal half of the analog VPI.
 *
 *   12.8   "The VPI routine vpi_get_analog_freq() shall be used determine the
 *          current frequency used in the small-signal analysis. The function
 *          shall return zero (0) during DC or transient analysis."
 *   12.10  "shall retrieve the simulation value of VPI analog vpiFlow or
 *          vpiPotential (node or branch) quantity objects", into Figure 12-3's
 *          structure, which carries a `real` union AND an `imaginary` one.
 *   11.6.7 gives a Quantity both a "real value" and an "imaginary value", both
 *          through vpi_get_analog_value().
 *
 * The imaginary union is the only place in the interface where a small-signal
 * solution can be read at all, and it is the half an implementation silently
 * leaves at zero. So this fixture needs a circuit whose phase is not 0 and not
 * 90 degrees, and whose rectangular components are exact decimals.
 *
 * THE HAND DERIVATION. p03_rc_ac injects 1 A into node a, loaded by R = 1 kohm
 * in parallel with C = 1e-3/(2*pi*1e3). At f = 1 kHz:
 *
 *     wC = 2*pi*1e3 * 1e-3/(2*pi*1e3) = 1e-3 = 1/R
 *     Y  = 1/R + jwC = 1e-3 * (1 + j)
 *     V(a) = 1 / Y = 1000/(1 + j) = 1000*(1 - j)/2
 *
 *     real part      = +500.0 V     exactly
 *     imaginary part = -500.0 V     exactly
 *     (magnitude 500*sqrt(2) = 707.1067811865476, phase -45 degrees)
 *
 * The 45-degree point is chosen for exactly this: a swapped real/imaginary pair
 * has the right magnitude and the wrong sign, and a sign-flipped imaginary part
 * has the right magnitude too — so magnitude alone would pass three wrong
 * implementations. The signed rectangular pair passes one.
 *
 * The DC half is 12.8's own sentence. This deck's large-signal solution is
 * identically zero (ac_stim contributes nothing to it, 4.5.11), and at that
 * solution vpi_get_analog_freq() must be 0. Both observations are required
 * before the fixture prints: an implementation that returns 0 always satisfies
 * the DC check and fails the AC one, and one that returns a stale 1000 through
 * the DC solve fails the DC one.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIXTURE DOES NOT CLAIM. 12.31.3 defines no callback reason whose
 * subject is "one frequency of a small-signal sweep". The plugin therefore
 * watches acbInitialStep, acbAcceptedPoint and acbFinalStep together and reads
 * vpi_get_analog_freq() to learn which kind of solution it is standing on —
 * which is what 12.8 is FOR. Pinning a per-frequency callback reason would
 * require inventing one, and this row does not invent callbacks.

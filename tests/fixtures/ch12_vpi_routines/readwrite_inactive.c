/* b8 a read-write callback is an inactive event: VAMS-2023 8.5.1 over
 * readwrite_inactive.v.
 *
 * 8.5.1  "The call back procedures scheduled with PLI routines such as
 *        tf_synchronize() ... or vpi_register_cb(cb_readwrite) ... shall be
 *        treated as inactive events."
 *
 * 8.5.1's regions at one time: active events, then explicit D2A, then
 * inactive events, then the nonblocking assign updates, then monitor events.
 * So a cbReadWriteSynch callback due at t runs AFTER the active events at t
 * and BEFORE the nonblocking updates at t.
 *
 * DERIVATION. At t=7 the design's process runs `b = 8'h11` (active) and
 * `r <= 8'h42` (its update is a nonblocking assign update event). The
 * read-write callback registered for t=7 must therefore read b = 0x11 (the
 * active event has run) and r = 0x00 (the update has not). A host that runs
 * read-write callbacks after the whole time slice reads r = 0x42 and fails
 * here. The read-only callback at t=7 comes after every event of the time
 * (12.31.2 "after execution of events"), so it reads both new values; that
 * pins that the update did happen at 7 and the 0x00 is not a design quirk.

/* b7 time scaling: VAMS-2023 12.31.2, a time callback's scaled real time is
 * in the unit of its obj, and the routine is handed a structure of the
 * system's, not the registered one.
 *
 * 12.31.2  "When the cb_data_p->time->type is set to vpiScaledRealTime, the
 *          cb_data_p->obj field shall be used as the object for determining
 *          the time scaling." "cbAtStartOfSimTime Callback shall occur before
 *          execution of events in a specified time queue." "cbAfterDelay
 *          Callback shall occur after a specified amount of time". "When a
 *          simulation-time-related callback occurs, the user callback
 *          application shall be passed a single argument, which is a pointer
 *          to an s_cb_data structure (this is not a pointer to the same
 *          structure which was passed to vpi_register_cb()). The time
 *          structure shall contain the current simulation time."
 *
 * DERIVATION (b7_scales.v: simulation unit 1 ns; b7_scales 1 ns, its
 * instance u of b7_scales_sub 1 us). Registered at end of compile, t=0:
 *   A  cbAtStartOfSimTime, vpiScaledRealTime 3.0, obj u:
 *      3.0 us = 3000 ticks. Fires at t=3000, before that queue's events, so
 *      tick still reads 0; its time, in u's unit, 3.0.
 *   B  cbAtStartOfSimTime, vpiScaledRealTime 3.0, obj b7_scales:
 *      3.0 ns = 3 ticks. Fires at t=3; its time 3.0.
 *   C  cbAfterDelay, vpiScaledRealTime 0.5, obj u:
 *      0.5 us = 500 ticks after t=0. Fires at t=500; its time 0.5.
 * A tool that scaled by the simulation unit instead fires A and B at 3 and C
 * at 0 (0.5 ns rounds to 0 or 1 tick); one that ignored obj for b7_scales's
 * unit would fire A at 3. Each value is exact in binary64 (3000/1000,
 * 3/1, 500/1000), so compared with ==. Each routine's argument is not the
 * address of the structure it was registered with.

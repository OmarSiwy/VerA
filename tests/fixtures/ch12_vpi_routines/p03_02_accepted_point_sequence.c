/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.31.3: the shape of the acbAcceptedPoint sequence, and the
 * identity that ties it to 12.7's delta.
 *
 *   12.31.3  acbInitialStep     "Upon acceptance of the first analog solution"
 *            acbFinalStep       "Upon acceptance of the last analog solution"
 *            acbAcceptedPoint   "Upon acceptance of the solution at the given
 *                                time"
 *   12.7     vpi_get_analog_delta() "returns the elapsed time between the
 *            latest converged and accepted solution and the solution being
 *            calculated".
 *   8.4.7    "the analog engine can either accept or reject that solution; it
 *            cannot calculate a solution for a future time until it has
 *            accepted the solution for the current time."
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT DERIVABLE. The NUMBER of accepted points in a transient is
 * the step controller's business and no clause fixes it, so this fixture never
 * asserts a count of accepted points. Everything it does assert is forced by
 * the text above for any conforming engine:
 *
 *   - acbInitialStep fires exactly ONCE, and before any acbAcceptedPoint:
 *     "the first analog solution" is singular and precedes the rest.
 *   - acbFinalStep fires exactly ONCE, after every acbAcceptedPoint: "the last
 *     analog solution".
 *   - accepted times are STRICTLY INCREASING. 8.4.7 forbids advancing before
 *     accepting, so two accepted points cannot share a time and cannot go
 *     backwards.
 *   - at every accepted point after the first, vpi_get_analog_delta() equals
 *     that point's time minus the previous ACCEPTED point's time. This is
 *     12.7 read literally, and it is the assertion that separates a correct
 *     implementation from the common bug: reporting the last ATTEMPTED step
 *     size, which differs from this by exactly the rejected trials.
 *   - the last accepted point is at t = tstop = 5e-3 exactly. A `.tran 0 5m`
 *     that stopped at 4.87e-3 has not produced "the last analog solution" of
 *     the requested interval; the engine must land on the endpoint.
 *
 * The 5e-3 endpoint and the delta identity are the hand-derived numbers. Both
 * are exact: 5e-3 is the deck's own stop time, and the delta identity is a
 * subtraction of two doubles the engine itself produced.

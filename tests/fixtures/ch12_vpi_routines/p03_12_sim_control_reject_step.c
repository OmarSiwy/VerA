/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.36: vpi_sim_control(vpiRejectTransientStep) rejects the
 * analog solution awaiting acceptance.
 *
 *   12.36    "vpiRejectTransientStep — cause the current analog simulation
 *            time point to be rejected. This operation shall pass one
 *            argument which is the current timestep (delta)."
 *            Returns "1 (true) if successful; 0 (false) on a failure".
 *   12.31.3  acbConvergenceTest "Prior acceptance of the analog solution for
 *            the given time": the moment a solution exists and is not yet
 *            accepted, so the moment it can be rejected.
 *   8.4.7    "it cannot calculate a solution for a future time until it has
 *            accepted the solution for the current time."
 *
 * p03_05 rejects through the callback's return value. This plugin returns 0
 * (accept) from every acbConvergenceTest and rejects ONCE through the routine
 * instead, at the first test at t >= 2e-3. What is forced:
 *
 *   - the call returns 1: a transient point after the first is awaiting
 *     acceptance, so the operation has something to act on;
 *   - the next acbConvergenceTest is at a time STRICTLY LESS than the rejected
 *     one, with no acbAcceptedPoint between (the same ordering p03_05 pins);
 *   - the run still reaches acbFinalStep at t == 5e-3 exactly.
 *
 * And the refusal: from the startup routine no analysis is running, so there
 * is no "current analog simulation time point" and the call must fail — 0,
 * with vpi_chk_error set.

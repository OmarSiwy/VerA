/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.31.3: acbConvergenceTest rejects a solution and the engine
 * backs up.
 *
 *   12.31.3  acbConvergenceTest  "Prior acceptance of the analog solution for
 *            the given time (this callback allows rejection of the analog
 *            solution at that time and backup to an earlier time)"
 *            acbAcceptedPoint    "Upon acceptance of the solution at the given
 *            time"
 *   8.4.7    "the analog engine can either accept or reject that solution; it
 *            cannot calculate a solution for a future time until it has
 *            accepted the solution for the current time."
 *
 * THE ONE DEGREE OF FREEDOM THE LRM LEAVES, stated here so it is a decision and
 * not a silent assumption: Figure 12-17 types cb_rtn as returning an int, and
 * 12.31.3 gives acbConvergenceTest the power to reject, but no clause spells the
 * encoding. This fixture FIXES it, matching every other callback in the
 * interface where 0 is the uneventful return: 0 accepts, non-zero rejects. An
 * implementation that chooses the opposite polarity fails this fixture, and
 * should change the fixture and say so — it must not leave the question open,
 * because an application cannot be written against an unspecified return.
 *
 * The plugin rejects exactly ONE solution: the first attempt at a time >= 2e-3.
 * Everything asserted is then forced by the clauses above:
 *
 *   - rejections issued == 1. The plugin counts its own returns, so this is
 *     exact by construction and the assertion is that the engine asked again
 *     rather than giving up.
 *   - after the rejection the next acbConvergenceTest arrives at a time
 *     STRICTLY LESS than the rejected one — 12.31.3's "backup to an earlier
 *     time". A host that merely re-attempts the same time has not backed up.
 *   - no acbAcceptedPoint ever carries the rejected time with the rejected
 *     attempt: 8.4.7 forbids accepting what was rejected. Since the run may
 *     later reach that same time on a shorter step and accept it, the exact
 *     assertion is the ordering one — no acbAcceptedPoint at all between the
 *     rejection and the following (earlier) convergence test.
 *   - every acbAcceptedPoint at time t is preceded by an acbConvergenceTest at
 *     the same t. "Prior acceptance" makes the test a precondition of the
 *     acceptance, not an independent stream.
 *   - the run still completes: acbFinalStep at t == 5e-3 exactly. A rejection
 *     the engine mishandles by stalling or by running past tstop is caught here
 *     and nowhere else.

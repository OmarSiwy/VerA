/* P03 REJECT — VAMS-2023 12.31.3: an analog time callback needs an analog
 * time.
 *
 *   12.31.3  "acbAbsTime  Upon acceptance of the analog solution for the given
 *             time (this callback shall force a solution at that time)
 *             acbElapsedTime  Upon acceptance of the solution advanced from the
 *             current solution by the given interval (this callback shall force
 *             a solution at that time)"
 *   12.31    vpi_register_cb() "shall register" the callback — and returns the
 *             handle, which an application checks against NULL.
 *   12.2     every failure is reported with a state, a code and a message.
 *
 * Both reasons are defined by "the given time": an analysis instant, which is
 * a real number of seconds (12.9 reports it as a `double`). A registration that
 * gives none, or gives one no analysis can reach, names no solution to force
 * and no acceptance to wait for, so it cannot be kept. FOUR such registrations,
 * each refused with NULL and an error:
 *
 *   acbAbsTime,     time = NULL                  no time at all
 *   acbAbsTime,     time->type = vpiSimTime      a digital tick count, not an
 *                                                analog instant in seconds
 *   acbAbsTime,     time->real = -1e-3           before every analysis starts
 *   acbElapsedTime, time->real = NaN             no interval
 *
 * THE CONTROL, without which "refuse everything" passes: a well-formed
 * acbAbsTime at 0.5e-3 is kept, fires exactly once, and fires at 0.5e-3 —
 * 12.31.3's "shall force a solution at that time" makes that exact equality
 * the clause's own number. (Forcing itself is p03_03's; this control pins
 * delivery, which is what a refusal must not also suppress.)

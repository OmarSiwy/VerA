/* b 20.3 task as function — a user system task in an expression, over
 * b_20_3_task_as_function.v (`x = $random;`).
 *
 * IEEE 1364-2005 §20.3, p. 367: "A user task can be used in the same places a
 * Verilog HDL task can be used (see 10.2). A user-defined system task can
 * read and modify the arguments of the task, but does not return any value."
 * §20.4, p. 367: "If a user-provided PLI application is associated with the
 * same name as a built-in system task/function (using the PLI mechanism),
 * the user-provided C application shall override the built-in system
 * task/function".
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * The startup routine registers $random as a vpiSysTask, which overrides the
 * built-in function (§20.4). The design's `x = $random;` then puts a task
 * where only an expression can stand; a task returns no value, so the design
 * is refused before time 0: the host exits 1, naming $random, and neither
 * this application's cbStartOfSimulation nor the design's $display runs.
 * build.zig's vpi_runs row pins the refusal (`.refuse`). Legal neighbour:
 * b_26_1_systf.c, whose $unsigned override is registered as a vpiSysFunc and
 * called as a function.

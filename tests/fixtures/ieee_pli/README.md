# Required inherited PLI host probes

These files are not ordinary digital-runner tests. Each C application must be
linked/loaded into the actual simulator before elaboration, register through
the production startup mechanism, and execute its paired HDL. Compare the
complete HDL transcript with `.expected.txt`, require the final callback's
`.expected.stderr.txt` marker, and require successful process exit. The marker
is mandatory: matching values alone cannot prove both callbacks executed.
Do not substitute a mock implementation, call the callbacks manually,
or interpret registration/header compilation as execution evidence.

`audit_builtin_override` targets IEEE1364-2005 20.4, with callback mechanics
from26.1.1–26.1.4/27.34. The override's fixed40-bit return is independent of
the two argument widths. Both values are derived in the HDL header. C asserts
user_data preservation, build-before-runtime phases, one sizetf invocation,
per-source-call compiletf invocation, per-execution calltf and call/argument
widths. Different argument values distinguish the original built-in behavior.

Current disposition: **open required positive**. The current production
`vpi_user.h` lacks registration/value declarations and the linked test host
only walks declarations after compiling the design. No runtime invocation
interface exists here to execute this probe correctly. Missing registration
is not an allowed exclusion. This folder does not yet enter an executable
conformance denominator; `docs/conformance-ieee-pli-overview-review.md` records
its source boundary and the observed header-check failure.

`audit_end_compile_objects` is a separate plugin/deck. Startup performs only
the registration permitted by IEEE26.2.4; traversal and numeric/string type
queries run at cbEndOfCompile, where full API access becomes available. Require
exit0, empty HDL stdout and its mandatory `.expected.stderr.txt` marker. This
does not demand a particular diagnostic for forbidden early API calls. It is
also blocked by the missing production callback declarations/host integration.

`audit_module_array` separately tests IEEE26.6.1/26.6.2: array object versus
member object types, membership cardinality, reverse relationship, expression
index, direct indexed access and a successful absent index on the nonarray
top. Member iteration order is deliberately unconstrained. Require exit0,
empty HDL stdout and its `.expected.stderr.txt` marker. Header syntax checking
currently fails before linking; this is not executed object-graph coverage.

`audit_array_object_kinds` tests IEEE26.6.7–26.6.9 at end compile: legacy
memory/word methods return reg-array/reg types, word size counts bits, array
size counts members, and a real variable array exposes var-select objects.
It reads declaration/index expressions only, never uninitialized HDL values.
Require exit0, empty HDL stdout and its mandatory stderr marker. As with the
other probes, missing production APIs block compilation/execution today.
# Lazy argument evaluation

`audit_lazy_arguments.c` + `.v` is the required-positive IEEE26.6.19(e)
application. Load before elaboration; compare HDL stdout to its
`.expected.txt`, stderr to `.expected.stderr.txt`, and require exit0.
The first unread side-effect function argument must not execute; the second
is evaluated when the plugin requests its value. Current production-header
syntax compilation fails for missing registration/value/callback support;
no execution is claimed. This is not an expected-rejection fixture.

## Routine probes and compile-only visibility

The audit_vpi_value_formats, audit_vpi_event_handles and
audit_vpi_invalid_time_callback applications require the same real lifecycle
host. Their expected stdout markers must match exactly, with successful exit;
none is a standalone HDL conformance test. The event probe uses current zero,
predecessor one and replacement two to avoid requiring a handle for an
equal-current-value event. Cancelling the replacement must leave zero.

The existing test-vpi-fixtures runner compiles these C clients only. A compile
pass does not assert the paired HDL, callback markers, event timing or runtime
results. Missing API compilation is a failure, never an expected rejection.

/* b 27 mcd — vpi_printf() and the multichannel descriptor routines, over
 * b_27_mcd.v, from a cbReadWriteSynch at t=0 (after the HDL's two $fopen).
 * Every file is a relative name, so it lands in the run's working directory.
 *
 * IEEE 1364-2005:
 *
 * §27.22, p. 440-441: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_close() shall close the
 * file(s) specified by a multichannel descriptor, mcd. Several channels can be
 * closed simultaneously because channels are represented by discrete bits in
 * the integer mcd. On success, this routine shall return a 0; on error, it
 * shall return the mcd value of the unclosed channels. This routine can also
 * be used to close file descriptors that were opened using the system function
 * $fopen()." "The following descriptors are predefined and cannot be closed
 * using vpi_mcd_close(): descriptor 1 is for the output channel of the
 * software product that invoked the PLI application and the current log file"
 *
 * §27.24, p. 441: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_name() shall return the name of a
 * file represented by a single-channel descriptor, cd. On error, the routine
 * shall return NULL. ... This routine can be used to get the name of any file
 * opened using the system function $fopen or the VPI routine vpi_mcd_open().
 * The channel descriptor cd could be an fd file descriptor returned from
 * $fopen (indicated by the most significant bit being set) or an mcd
 * multichannel descriptor returned by either the system function $fopen or
 * the VPI routine vpi_mcd_open()."
 *
 * §27.25, p. 442: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_open() shall open a file for
 * writing and shall return a corresponding multichannel description number
 * (mcd). The channel descriptor 1 (least significant bit) is reserved for
 * representing the output channel of the software product that invoked the
 * PLI application and the log file (if one is currently open). The channel
 * descriptor 32 (most significant bit) is reserved to represent a file
 * descriptor (fd) returned from the Verilog HDL $fopen system function." "The
 * vpi_mcd_open() routine shall return a 0 on error. If the file has already
 * been opened either by a previous call to vpi_mcd_open() or using $fopen in
 * the Verilog source code, then vpi_mcd_open() shall return the descriptor
 * number."
 *
 * §27.26, p. 443: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_printf() shall write to one or more
 * channels (up to 31) determined by the mcd. ... Channel 1 is reserved for the
 * output channel of the software product that invoked the PLI application and
 * the current log file." "vpi_mcd_printf() shall also write to a file
 * represented by an mcd that was returned from the Verilog HDL $fopen system
 * function. vpi_mcd_printf() shall not write to a file represented by an fd
 * file descriptor returned from $fopen (indicated by the most significant bit
 * being set)." "The format strings shall use the same format as the C
 * fprintf() routine. The routine shall return the number of characters printed
 * or return EOF if an error occurred."
 *
 * §27.28, p. 444: "The VPI routine vpi_printf() shall write to both the output
 * channel of the software product that invoked the PLI application and the
 * current product log file. The format string shall use the same format as the
 * C printf() routine. The routine shall return the number of characters
 * printed or return EOF if an error occurred."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * The HDL holds hm = $fopen("b_27_mcd_hdl.log") (an mcd, msb clear) and
 * hf = $fopen("b_27_mcd_fd.log", "w") (an fd, msb set).
 *
 *   §27.28  vpi_printf("b27 printf %d %s\n", 7, "ok") expands to
 *           "b27 printf 7 ok\n", 16 characters, on the output channel.
 *   §27.25  a = open("b_27_mcd_a.log"), b = open("b_27_mcd_b.log"): each a
 *           single bit, neither bit 0 (channel 1) nor bit 31, and a != b.
 *           Opening a's file again returns a; opening the HDL's file returns
 *           hm. A NULL name is an error: 0.
 *   §27.26  (a, "alpha\n") 6; (a|b, "both\n"), one call, both files: 5
 *           characters, or 10 if the count is summed over the two channels
 *           (the clause does not say which);
 *           (hm, "hdl\n") 4; (1, "b27 mcd1\n") 9 characters, on the output
 *           channel; (hf, "no\n") must write nothing to the fd's file.
 *   §27.24  name(a) "b_27_mcd_a.log"; name(hf) "b_27_mcd_fd.log"; name(a|b)
 *           is no single channel, and the highest channel bit below the
 *           fd bit that is none of a, b, hm or the descriptor the HDL file's
 *           open returned was never opened: NULL.
 *   §27.22  close(a|b) 0, then the files read "alpha\nboth\n" (11 bytes) and
 *           "both\n" (5). close(1) cannot close channel 1: returns 1.
 *           close(a) again: a is not open, so a is unclosed: returns a.
 *           close(hm) 0, then the HDL's file reads "hdl\n". close(hf) 0: the
 *           routine "can also be used to close file descriptors that were
 *           opened using the system function $fopen()", after which hf names
 *           no file (§27.24's NULL).

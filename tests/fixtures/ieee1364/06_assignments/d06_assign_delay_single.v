// §8.5.3.1: the continuous assignment "corresponds to a process, sensitive to
// the source elements in the expression. When the value of the expression
// changes, it causes an active update event to be added to the event queue"
// — the `delay3` is how far in the future that update event is placed
// (6.1.3 of IEEE Std 1364 Verilog, the clause A.6.1's `delay3` belongs to).
//
// A SINGLE delay value is used for every transition direction. This fixture
// pins the delivery INSTANT, not merely "some delay happened": the `#0` reads
// sample the inactive region (§8.5.3.3 "If the delay is 0, the process is
// scheduled as an inactive event for the current time"), which is drained
// AFTER every active update of that same time. So a read at t showing the old
// value and a read at t+1 showing the new value bracket the delivery to
// exactly t+1.

// Verilog-AMS LRM 2.4 §8.5.3.1 Continuous assignment:
//   "A continuous assignment statement (6.1 of IEEE Std 1364 Verilog)
//    corresponds to a process, sensitive to the source elements in the
//    expression. When the value of the expression changes, it causes an ACTIVE
//    UPDATE EVENT to be added to the event queue, using current values to
//    determine the target."
//
// Two separable claims are pinned here.
//   (a) SENSITIVITY IS TO EVERY SOURCE ELEMENT of the expression, not just to
//       the one that happens to be selected. `sel`, `a` and `b` are all source
//       elements of `sel ? a : b`.
//   (b) The update is an ACTIVE UPDATE EVENT: §8.5.3.3 puts the `#0` read in
//       the inactive region of the same time, by which point the active region
//       has been drained and the new value is visible. A read taken in the
//       same active region, straight after the blocking assignment, is NOT
//       asserted: IEEE 1364-2005 §11.5 gives this exact program shape and says
//       "The simulator is correct in displaying either a 1 or a 0."
//

//   t=0  a=0, b=1, sel=0            -> expression = b = 1, update queued

//   t=1  sel:=1   (blocking)        -> expression becomes a = 0, update QUEUED

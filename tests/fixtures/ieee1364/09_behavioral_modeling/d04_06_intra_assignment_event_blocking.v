// §8.5.3.3's rule is written for "a delay", and the event form is the same rule
// with the resumption condition changed from a time to an edge: the right-hand
// side is computed with the values current when the statement is reached, the
// process suspends, and the assignment happens when it resumes.
//
// This is the sampling register of every synchronous model, and the reason it
// needs its own fixture is that explicit `@(posedge)` already works in VerA as a
// STATEMENT prefix — only the intra-assignment position is missing, and the two
// positions differ in exactly which value lands.
//
// HAND DERIVATION.
//   t=0   d<-0101; `q = @(posedge clk) d;` samples d = 0101 and suspends.
//         clk<-0 — x to 0 is a negedge, not a posedge, so nothing resumes.
//         (Both orderings of the two time-zero processes give this; the sample
//         of d is 0101 either way, since only this process writes d at t=0.)
//   t=5   d<-1110
//   t=10  clk 0->1 is a posedge: q<-0101, the value sampled at t=0.
//         display reads d at t=10, which is 1110.
//         -> "intra_event 0101 1110"
//
// The prefix form `@(posedge clk) q = d;` would give "intra_event 1110 1110".
// Not suspending at all gives "intra_event 0101 0101".

// Historical filename retained; this is now a POSITIVE DIGITAL fixture.
// IEEE1364-2005 §17.2.9 printed297 requires a WARNING, not a load refusal,
// when word count differs from the requested range and no @ addresses occur.
// Five sequential words11,22,33,44,55 fill four locations with11,22,33,44.
// Loading stops at the highest location; the fifth word has no destination.
// The former rejection rule wrongly required an error. That claim is withdrawn
// to IEEE-FILE-MEM-002 in docs/conformance-ieee-fileio-review.md.
// The positive runner requires successful continuation, exact loaded data,
// and a warning diagnostic header matching both the code and specific phrase.
// These warning expectations are the new bounded implementation contract;
// the previous CLI loaded the data but silently omitted the required warning.

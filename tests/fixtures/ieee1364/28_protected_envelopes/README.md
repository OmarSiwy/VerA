# Protected-envelope regressions

The five `protect_*_metadata.v` cases assert acceptance of legal metadata
around ordinary unprotected HDL. Their scope is syntax acceptance; they do
not establish encryption-service behavior.

The six `protected_*.v` cases contain real DES-CBC ciphertext, with base64
and historical uuencoding, SHA-1/MD5 digests, a session-key block, or eight
nested envelopes. The decrypted statement expands a macro from outside the
envelope and must print `decrypted=42`. Ignoring an envelope cannot pass.
`verify_vectors.py` decrypts and checks the test data independently using
OpenSSL, including the recorded digests.

`known_keys.json` contains **public test keys** and the exact test-host
profile. IEEE 1364 specifies the algorithms but does not standardize key
provisioning, CBC IV transport, padding, or a tool's invocation spelling.
The profile chooses these details explicitly. It is not a claim that every
vendor accepts the same encrypted file without an adapter.

Current VerA rejects the protect directive with E0146. These are expected
failures. After adding decryption support, the test host must provision
this profile through the engine's actual key-provider interface before
removing the marker. No such interface or engine implementation is added
by these tests. A failure at key lookup must not be confused with a failed
cryptographic comparison.

Encryption-service round trips, asymmetric public-key serialization,
licensing callbacks and viewport access need further host profiles. Their
remaining obligations are listed in `tests/fixtures/conformance/GAPS.tsv`; neither
these inputs nor syntax acceptance earns passing evidence for them.

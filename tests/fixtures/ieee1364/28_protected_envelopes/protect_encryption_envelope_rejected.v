// IEEE 1364-2005 §28.1: "An encryption envelope begins in the source text
// when a begin pragma expression is encountered. The end of the encryption
// envelope occurs at the point where an end pragma expression is
// encountered." §28.2.1: tools that provide encryption services "shall
// transform source text containing encryption envelopes by replacing each
// encryption envelope with a decryption envelope".
//
// The cleartext between the two directives is ordinary Verilog, so ignoring
// them would compile. It would also silently drop the author's request that
// the text be protected, and VerA does not implement clause 28 (ROADMAP.md
// §1 B), so the first `pragma protect is refused by name (E0146).

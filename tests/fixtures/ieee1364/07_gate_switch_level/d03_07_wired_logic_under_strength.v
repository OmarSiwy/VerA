// Verilog-AMS LRM 2.4 annex A.2.2.1 gives `wand`/`wor` as net types and annex
// A.2.2.2 gives the drive strengths; §1.1 makes the combination IEEE Std 1364
// Verilog's clause 7 wired-logic resolution. The wired-logic tables apply only
// between drivers of EQUAL strength. IEEE 1364-2005 7.10.4: "The net types
// triand, wand, trior, and wor shall resolve conflicts when multiple drivers
// have the same strength." 7.10.1: "If two or more signals of unequal strength
// combine in a wired net configuration, the stronger signal shall dominate all
// the weaker drivers and determine the result." (4.6.2's tables are stated
// "assuming equal strengths for both drivers".)
//
// The `highz0` driver's 0 asserts NOTHING: it is z, and z is the identity of
// all three wired tables, so it cannot pull a wand down.
//
// CORRECTED GOLDEN. This file used to assert wa=0 at t=1 and wo=1 at t=2 by
// reading the tables across unequal strengths. Under 7.10.1 both are wrong:
// St1 against We0 on the wand is 1, St0 against We1 on the wor is 0. VerA
// prints the old values, hence the xfail.
//
// Only the resolved VALUE is asserted here. The strength of a wired-logic
// result is not observable from this runner: `%v` is not implemented (see
// docs/CLAUSE-AUDIT.md row 17.1-07) and there are no switch primitives to
// propagate it into (D08).

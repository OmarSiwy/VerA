// vdd is a supply1 net: Su1 from time 0, with no driver that ever changes.
// t1 is an uncontrolled tran, so it conducts from time 0, and c has no
// driver of its own: c carries vdd's Su1 reduced to strong, St1, value 1.

//! xfail VerA resolves a pass-switch group only when a driver in it or a switch control changes; an uncontrolled tran whose group has no driver event (a supply net onto an undriven net) is never resolved, so c keeps its undriven z (%v printed HiZ on 2026-10-08). Fix: resolve each uncontrolled tran's group once at time 0 in src/sim/digital/root.zig, without a .tran_switch event, which the native emitter refuses at elaboration

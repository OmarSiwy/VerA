// IEEE 1364-2005 §7.14.1, p. 102: "The syntax for delays on gate primitives
// (including UDPs; see Clause 8), nets, and continuous assignments shall allow
// three values each for the rising, falling, and turn-off delays. The minimum,
// typical, and maximum values for each delay shall be specified as expressions
// separated by colons. There shall be no required relation (e.g., min <= typ
// <= max) between the expressions for minimum, typical, and maximum delays.
// These can be any three expressions."
//
// A gate, a net and a continuous assignment each carry the unordered triple
// 5:3:1 as their rise delay. Which member a tool selects is not fixed by the
// clause, so each measured rise delay must be 1, 3 or 5:
//   a rises at t=20; each output's first change after t=20 is at 20 + d,
//   d in {1, 3, 5} -> ok=1 for all three.
// The bufif1 carries three triples (rise, fall, turn-off), each unordered.
// Line: "ok=1 ok=1 ok=1 ok=1".

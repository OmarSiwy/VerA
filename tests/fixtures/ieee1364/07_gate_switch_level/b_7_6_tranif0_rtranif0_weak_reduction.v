// IEEE 1364-2005 §7.6, p. 85: "When tranif0, tranif1, rtranif0, or rtranif1
// devices are turned off, they shall block signals; and when they are turned
// on, they shall pass signals." The prose never says which control level
// turns the `if0` pair on; the reading taken here is the one their names
// share with bufif0/notif0 (Table 7-5: enabled by a 0 control), i.e. on at 0,
// off at 1. §7.11, p. 100: "The tran, tranif0, and tranif1 switches shall not
// affect signal strength across the bidirectional terminals, except that a supply strength shall
// be reduced to a strong strength." §7.12, Table 7-8: "Strong drive -> Pull
// drive" and "Weak drive -> Medium capacitor" for rtran/rtranif0/rtranif1/
// rnmos/rpmos/rcmos. Strength levels (Table 7-7): supply 7, strong 6, pull
// 5, weak 3, medium 2. Equal strengths of opposite value give x (§7.10.1).
//
// b_7_12_resistive_reduction_table.v covers the supply, strong and pull rows
// through rnmos/rcmos/rpmos/rtranif1/rtran; this file covers the two enable
// switches no fixture ran (tranif0, rtranif0) and the weak -> medium row.

// IEEE1364-2005 §11.4.2: "active events can be taken off the queue and
// processed in any order", so the LRM would also accept "timeout" here. VerA
// documents one order (docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) and this pins it, so it cites
// no clause: every engine wakes the event controls a change satisfies in the
// order they suspended, as `vera --run` does, so a native executable never
// misses an edge the interpreter sees.
// Time 1: the fork (§9.8.2) starts its arms. Arm 1 suspends at
// @(posedge clk). Arm 2 sets kick, which wakes the always block; it flips
// go to 1 while nobody waits on go and suspends again, after arm 1. Time 2:
// clk rises. Arm 1 suspended first, so it resumes first and suspends at
// @(go); the always block then flips go back to 0, which wakes arm 1:
// "arm saw go=0 at 2". Arm 3 is done, so the join completes at 2.

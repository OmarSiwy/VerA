// IEEE1364-2005 §11.4.2: "active events can be taken off the queue and
// processed in any order", so the LRM would also accept an early end with
// neither line printed. VerA documents one order (docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) and
// this pins it, so it cites no clause: a native executable's levelized logic
// never updates a net some process waits on ahead of the order `vera --run`
// updates it in.
// Time 1: a = 1111 schedules s = a ^ b (§6.1). The fork (§9.8.2) then
// starts its arms. s runs: 1111 ^ 1111 = 0000, which schedules q = |s after
// the arms. Arm 1 suspends at @(negedge q); q then falls 1 -> 0 and wakes
// it: "negedge q at 1". Arm 2 ends at 3, and so does the join.

// IEEE 1364-2005 §18.4.3, p. 346, Syntax 18-29:
//   pport_value 0_strength_component 1_strength_component identifier_code
// "p Key character that indicates a port. There is no space between the p
// and the port_value." "0_strength_component One of the eight Verilog
// strengths that indicates the strength0 specification for the port." (and
// likewise 1_strength_component), coded 0 highz, 1 small, 2 medium, 3 weak,
// 4 large, 5 pull, 6 strong, 7 supply.
// §18.4.3.1, pp. 346-347: "INPUT (TESTFIXTURE): D low, U high, N unknown, Z
// three-state ... OUTPUT (DUT): L low, H high, X unknown (do-not care), T
// three-state, l low (two or more drivers active), h high (two or more
// drivers active) ... UNKNOWN DIRECTION: 0 low (both input and output are
// active with 0 value), 1 high (both input and output are active with 1
// value) ... f unknown (input and output three-stated)".
// §18.4.3.2, p. 347: "Drivers are considered only in terms of primitives,
// continuous assignments, and procedural continuous assignments." ... "If
// both input and output are driving the same value with the same range of
// strength, then this is a conflict. The resolved value is 0/1, and the
// strength is the stronger of the two." ... "If the input is driving a weak
// strength (range) and the output is driving a strong strength (range), then
// the resolved value is l/h, and the strength is the strength of the output."
// "Strength supply 7 to 5 (large): strong strength — Strength 4 to 1: weak
// strength".
// §18.4.4 (pp. 347-348) is the worked example; its lines `pD 6 0`, `pU 0 6`,
// `pN 6 6`, `pX 6 6`, `pH 0 6` and `pf 0 0` fix how a strong driver's
// strengths and a released inout read.
//
// u = b_18_4_3_dev: inputs a, b, output y = a | b (a continuous assignment,
// strong), inout io driven by u through `assign io = den ? dval : 1'bz`
// (strong). The test fixture drives a and b from regs through the port
// connections, and io through two continuous assignments, one strong and one
// (weak0, weak1). Codes: <0 a, <1 b, <2 y, <3 io (port order). One initial
// block makes every change, so none races another.
//
// The reader prints every token after `$enddefinitions $end`, one value
// change per line, skipping any $comment section; within a time record it
// prints the changes in code order, whatever order the file lists them in,
// since §18.4 does not fix that order.
//
// HAND DERIVATION (one line per value change; times in 1ns):
//   #0 $dumpports: a = 0 strong -> pD 6 0 <0; b = 1 -> pU 0 6 <1;
//      y = 0 | 1 = 1 from u -> pH 0 6 <2; io: the fixture (strong 1) and u
//      (strong 1) both drive 1 in the strong range -> p1 0 6 <3; $end.
//   #1 a = x -> pN 6 6 <0 (y = x | 1 = 1, unchanged).
//   #2 b = 0 -> pD 6 0 <1; y = x | 0 = x -> pX 6 6 <2.
//   #3 the fixture's io driver turns weak 0, u's strong 0: input weak,
//      output strong -> pl 6 0 <3 (the strength is the output's).
//   #4 u releases io; the fixture's weak 0 alone: an input low of weak
//      strength -> pD 3 0 <3.
//   #5 the fixture releases io too: both three-stated -> pf 0 0 <3.

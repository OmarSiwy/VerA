// Shared self-check macros for the exhaustive testbenches. LRM §10.3 `define.
//
// A fixture states its OWN expectation and prints the comparison, so the golden
// transcript is readable rather than merely diffable:
//
//     `CHECK("tanh(0.5)", tanh(0.5), 0.46211715726000974, 1e-15);
//     -> tanh(0.5) got=0.46211715726 want=0.46211715726 ok=1
//
// The trailing `;` is the CALL SITE's, as it is for every Verilog macro: a
// `define expands to text, and §5.1 wants a statement terminator.
//
// `ok=1` is the assertion. A reviewer checks the WANT column against the LRM or
// a reference implementation once; after that a regression turns `ok=1` into
// `ok=0` and the runner fails on the diff.
//
// WHY THE VERDICT IS A NUMBER AND NOT A BRANCH. `if (ok) $strobe("PASS")` is the
// obvious shape and it does not work here: VerA hoists a module's display
// tasks into one straight-line unit, so a task under a conditional is dropped
// with W0851 (LRM §9.4.6 makes emission a property of the solve, which compiled
// device code has no way to consult). A comparison is an integer in Verilog-A
// (§4.2.5), so making the verdict an OPERAND keeps everything unconditional.

// RELATIONAL, and deliberately a weaker claim than the four above.
//
// The others pin a value against a literal a human derived, so VerA cannot
// supply its own expectation. This one pins two VerA expressions against EACH
// OTHER, for the rules the LRM states as an identity with no value to write
// down: `V(br)` must equal `V(a,b)`, `$ln(x)` must equal `ln(x)`, an
// `aliasparam` must name the same storage as the parameter it aliases.
//
// It is still restricting — a compiler that lowers the two sides differently
// fails it — but it is NOT independent: an error common to both sides passes.
// So it is a separate macro rather than a relaxation of `CHECK`, which keeps
// the weaker claims greppable and lets tests/torture.zig hold the strict
// literal rule everywhere else. Reach for it only when there is genuinely no
// literal to write; if you can write the digits, write the digits.

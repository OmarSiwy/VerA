// The design 10_systf_digital.c registers system tasks and functions against.
//
// Everything here is shaped so a COUNT is derivable. LRM 12.33.1 separates two
// rates — "Callbacks to the applications pointed to by the compiletf and sizetf
// fields shall occur when the simulation data structure is compiled or built"
// (once per CALL SITE) versus "Callbacks to the application pointed to by the
// calltf routine shall occur each time the system task or function is invoked
// during simulation execution" (once per EXECUTION). A design in which those
// two numbers are equal cannot tell the two apart, so $p02_sum appears at two
// call sites and one of them runs three times: 2 compiletf against 4 calltf.
//
// The loop index `i` is passed as the second argument of the looping call site
// so that the argument handles a calltf reads are re-read each invocation
// rather than frozen at build time: the three loop invocations must see 0, 1
// and 2.
//
// `timescale 1ns/1ns, matching p02_design.v, so the whole P02 set shares one
// simulation time unit.

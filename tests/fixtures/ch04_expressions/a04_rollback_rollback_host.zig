//! A04 — §4.5 stateful operators across a REJECTED TIMESTEP.
//!
//! WHY THIS IS NOT A `.va` FIXTURE. A rejected step is a sequence of host
//! calls, not a waveform: the driver evaluates a trial point, writes the
//! operators' accepted-step state, then decides the local error is too large,
//! REVERTS, and re-solves the same interval with a smaller dt. The `//!`
//! directive language walks `//! time` forward and calls `updateState` once per
//! entry, so it cannot express the revert at all. tests/limiter_host.zig
//! already established the pattern for exactly this problem on §4.5.15's
//! limiting state ("limiter state advances by generation and reverts a
//! rejected attempt") and tests/table_snapshot_host.zig for §9.21's snapshot;
//! this is their §4.5 operator-history counterpart.
//!
//! The subject is `slew` (a04_rollback_a04_rollback_ops.va), an operator that
//! keeps its history in the device. idt and ddt keep none: they are host
//! unknowns (§4.5.2), whose history the host's integrator owns and reverts.
//!
//! WHAT THE LRM REQUIRES. §4.5.9 bounds the output's rate of change over the
//! ACCEPTED waveform, and the accepted output at t = 1ns is a property of the
//! circuit, not of how many trial points were discarded on the way there.
//! §4.5.15 says the same from the other side: "It is important to ensure that
//! all analog operators are evaluated every iteration of a simulation to ensure
//! that the internal state is maintained ... These restrictions help prevent
//! usage which could cause the internal state to be corrupted or become
//! out-of-date."
//!
//! So the requirement this file encodes is: after a trial step to t = 2ns is
//! REJECTED and the step re-taken to t = 1ns, every §4.5 operator shall read
//! exactly what it would have read had the 2ns attempt never happened.
//!
//! THE HAND DERIVATION. V(p) is driven to t/1ns volts, twice the 0.5 V/ns
//! limit, so the output rises exactly 0.5 per nanosecond from its last
//! accepted value.
//!
//!   step            t      dt     slew    why
//!   dc              0       0     0.0     §4.5.9 "In DC analysis, slew()
//!                                         simply passes the value of the
//!                                         destination to its output"
//!   trial (reject)  2ns   2ns     1.0     0 + 0.5e9 · 2ns

//!   retry (accept)  1ns   1ns     0.5     0 + 0.5e9 · 1ns, NOT 1.0 (the
//!                                         discarded attempt's output, which
//!                                         the input 1.0 does not clamp)
//!   next  (accept)  2ns   1ns     1.0     0.5 + 0.5e9 · 1ns
//!
//! The last row is what makes this a test rather than a tautology: the run
//! reaches t = 2ns twice, once on a discarded attempt and once for real, and
//! the output there is 1.0 both times. An implementation whose history is
//! path-dependent reads a different number the second time.
//!
//! `stateCtl` commits and reverts every field `updateState` advances,
//! `State.t_prev` included: a revert that left t_prev at the discarded 2ns
//! would make the retry's dt negative. tests/revert_host.zig asserts the same
//! for every other device-held history. `zig build test` emits the device from
//! a04_rollback_a04_rollback_ops.va and runs this file.

/* 11 — vpi_register_analog_systf(), the derivtf phase, and the derivative
 * handles of vpi_handle_multi(vpiDerivative, ...).
 *
 * LRM 12.32: "The VPI routine vpi_register_analog_systf() shall register
 * callbacks for user-defined analog system tasks or functions. ... The
 * registration function (vpi_register_analog_systf() or vpi_register_systf())
 * with which the task or function is registered shall determine the context or
 * contexts from which the task or function can be invoked and how and when the
 * call backs associated with the function shall be called."
 *
 * LRM 12.32.1: "The compiletf, calltf, sizetf, and derivtf fields of the
 * s_vpi_analog_systf_data structure shall be pointers to the user-provided
 * applications which are to be invoked by the system task/function callback
 * mechanism. One or more of the compiletf, calltf, sizetf, and derivtf fields
 * can be set to NULL if they are not needed. Callbacks to the applications
 * pointed to by the compiletf and sizetf fields shall occur when the simulation
 * data structure is compiled or built" — and the derivtf callbacks "shall occur
 * when registering partial derivatives for the analog system task/function
 * arguments or return value."
 *
 * LRM 12.22.1: "The VPI routine vpi_handle_multi() is used to access the
 * derivative handles associated with analog system task/functions. The first
 * argument is the type vpiDerivative. The second is the handle for the
 * task/function argument for which a partial derivative is to be declared. The
 * third argument indicates the value with respect to which the derivative being
 * declared shall be calculated. ... For vpiDerivative, the vpi_handle_multi()
 * function can only be called for those derivatives allocated during the
 * derivtf phase of execution."
 *
 * LRM 12.32.2 (Declaring derivatives for analog system task/functions), on the
 * declarative nature of derivtf: it returns "a t_vpi_stf_partials data
 * structure containing the required information. The purpose of this function
 * is declarative only, it does not assign any value to the derivative being
 * declared." (An earlier revision of this header put that sentence at 12.32.1;
 * 12.32.1 is *System task and function callbacks* and carries the field and
 * build-phase sentences quoted further down, not this one.)
 *
 * LRM 12.22.2 prints the whole shape this file follows: derivs.count = 1,
 * derivative_of = {1}, derivative_to = {2}; then in calltf,
 * vpi_handle_by_index(funcHandle, 1..3), vpi_handle_multi(vpiDerivative,
 * i_handle, v_handle), and vpi_put_value of the conductance onto that handle.
 *
 * TWO SPELLINGS, AND WHY THIS FILE PICKS THE EXAMPLE'S. The LRM contradicts
 * itself about t_vpi_stf_partials, and an implementer who resolves it the other
 * way will not be able to COMPILE this file, so it is stated here rather than
 * discovered:
 *
 *   - 12.32.2's structure definition is
 *       typedef struct t_vpi_stf_partials { int count; int *derivative_of;
 *         int *derivative_wrt; } s_vpi_stf_partials, *p_vpi_stf_partials;
 *     which names the third field `derivative_wrt` and makes
 *     `t_vpi_stf_partials` a struct TAG only — `static t_vpi_stf_partials x;`
 *     is not legal C against it.
 *   - 12.22.2's example, the only executable code the LRM prints for this
 *     structure, writes `static t_vpi_stf_partials derivs;` and assigns
 *     `derivs.derivative_to`.
 *
 * This file follows the example (lines 149 and 159 below) because the example is
 * what an implementer copies and because P03's analog fixtures follow it too.
 * The consequence for src/vpi/vpi_user.h is stated in SPEC.md's header list: it
 * must typedef the name `t_vpi_stf_partials`, not only the tag, and the third
 * field must be reachable as `derivative_to`. An implementer who prefers
 * 12.32.2's `derivative_wrt` changes exactly one line here (159) and one line
 * of SPEC.md; nothing else in the row depends on the spelling.
 *
 * LRM 12.13: vpi_get_analog_systf_info() "shall return information about a
 * user-defined analog system task or function callback in an
 * s_vpi_analog_systf_data structure. The memory for this structure shall be
 * allocated by the user."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * p02_analog.va calls $p02_resistor at TWO call sites, with r1 = 1k and
 * r2 = 2k. LRM 2.6.2's Table 2-1 gives the scaled-notation symbol "K, k" the
 * value 1e3 (2.5 is Operators and says nothing about scale factors), and 2.6.2
 * prints `7k` among its own valid real constants, so the third argument reads
 * exactly 1000.0 at the first site and 2000.0 at the second, and the
 * conductances the application computes are
 *
 *   g1 = 1.0 / 1000.0 = 0.001      exact in binary64: IEEE division is
 *   g2 = 1.0 / 2000.0 = 0.0005     correctly rounded and the decimal literals
 *                                  parse to those same rounded values, so `==`
 *                                  is legal here without a tolerance.
 *
 * COUNTS. compiletf and derivtf are build-phase, once per call site: 2 each.
 * calltf is per evaluation, and an analog solver evaluates a contribution once
 * per Newton iteration, so its count is a property of the solver rather than of
 * the LRM — this file asserts only that it ran at least twice (once per site)
 * and that every compiletf and derivtf invocation preceded every calltf one.
 * The exact analog invocation ORDER and count belong to P03, not here.
 *
 * DERIVATIVE HANDLES. derivtf declares exactly one partial per call site:
 * of = argument 1 (the output `curr`), to = argument 2 (V(p,n)). So inside
 * calltf,
 *
 *   vpi_handle_multi(vpiDerivative, arg1, arg2)  must be non-NULL
 *   vpi_handle_multi(vpiDerivative, arg1, arg3)  must be NULL and set an error,
 *
 * the second because d(curr)/d(r) was never allocated during the derivtf phase
 * and 12.22.1 permits the call "only ... for those derivatives allocated during
 * the derivtf phase". A tool that hands out a handle for every pair makes the
 * declarative half of derivtf meaningless.

/* 07 — vpi_get_cb_info(), vpi_remove_cb(), and mutating the callback set from
 * inside a dispatch.
 *
 * LRM 12.6: "The VPI routine vpi_get_cb_info() shall return information about a
 * simulation-related callback in an s_cb_data structure. The memory for this
 * structure shall be allocated by the user."
 *
 * LRM 12.34: "The VPI routine vpi_remove_cb() shall remove callbacks which were
 * registered with vpi_register_cb(). The argument to this routine shall be a
 * handle to the callback object. The routine shall return a 1 (TRUE) if
 * successful, and a 0 (FALSE) on a failure. After vpi_remove_cb() is called
 * with a handle to the callback, the handle is no longer valid."
 *
 * LRM 12.33.2: "(Callbacks can also be registered or removed at any time during
 * an application routine, not just at startup time)." — which is the sentence
 * that makes the reentrancy below legal rather than undefined.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * Three callback lifetimes, each with a count that only comes out right if
 * removal and registration take effect at the exact moment they are performed.
 *
 * (A) SELF-REMOVAL DURING DISPATCH. `self` is a cbValueChange on p02_design.n,
 *     registered before time 0. n changes at t=0 (xxxx->0), 1 (->5), 2 (->9)
 *     and 4 (->2), and is rewritten without changing at t=3. `self` calls
 *     vpi_remove_cb on its OWN handle during its second invocation, i.e. while
 *     the t=1 dispatch is still on the stack. It must therefore be invoked
 *     exactly TWICE — at t=0 and t=1 — and not at t=2 or t=4. Three
 *     invocations would mean removal only took effect at the end of the current
 *     time step; four would mean it did nothing.
 *
 * (B) REGISTRATION DURING DISPATCH. From that same second invocation, `self`
 *     registers `heir`, another cbValueChange on n. The remaining changes on n
 *     are at t=2 and t=4, so `heir` must be invoked exactly TWICE, carrying 9
 *     and 2. Zero invocations would mean a registration made during a dispatch
 *     is lost; three would mean it somehow also saw the t=1 change it was
 *     created by.
 *
 * (C) REMOVAL BEFORE THE NEXT EVENT. `early` is a cbValueChange on
 *     p02_design.g, whose changes are at t=0 (xx->01), 5, 10 and 20. It is
 *     removed from an unrelated cbAtStartOfSimTime(2) callback, which is after
 *     the t=0 change and before the t=5 one. `early` must therefore be invoked
 *     exactly ONCE.
 *
 *     The removal call itself must return 1. A SECOND vpi_remove_cb with the
 *     same handle must return 0, because "after vpi_remove_cb() is called with
 *     a handle to the callback, the handle is no longer valid" — the only
 *     honest answer for an invalid handle is the documented failure value, and
 *     a routine that returns 1 twice is claiming to have removed the same
 *     callback twice.
 *
 * (D) ROUND TRIP. Before `early` is removed, vpi_get_cb_info() on its handle
 *     must report back every field the registration set: reason cbValueChange,
 *     cb_rtn the same function pointer, obj an object vpi_compare_objects()
 *     calls equal to g, user_data the same pointer, time->type vpiSimTime and
 *     value->format vpiIntVal. This is the only routine in P02 that can catch a
 *     registration that silently dropped a field.

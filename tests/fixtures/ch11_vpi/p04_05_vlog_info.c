/* p04 05 — vpi_get_vlog_info(), 12.17.
 *
 * LRM 12.17: "The VPI routine vpi_get_vlog_info() shall obtain the following
 * information about Verilog-AMS product execution: The number of invocation
 * options (argc); Invocation option values (argv); Product and version
 * strings. The information shall be contained in an s_vpi_vlog_info
 * structure. The routine shall return TRUE on success and FALSE on failure."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * The product here is the VPI host `zig build` runs (build.zig, `vpi_runs`):
 * it is invoked as `<host> <design>`, with exactly one option, the path of
 * p04_objects.v. So argc is 2, argv[0] is the host's own name, and argv[1]
 * ends in "p04_objects.v" (the build passes it as an absolute path, so only
 * the tail is fixed). C's own rule for argv, which the structure's
 * `char **argv` inherits, is that argv[argc] is NULL.
 *
 * The product string is the product's name — VerA — and the version string
 * is non-empty; its digits are not asserted, because no clause fixes them.
 *
 * FAILURE: the structure "has been allocated by the user" in every other
 * routine that fills one (12.6, 12.14, 12.16); with no structure there is
 * nothing to fill, so vpi_get_vlog_info(NULL) is the routine's failure —
 * FALSE, with the error 12.2 reports.
 *
 * Called twice, from the startup routine and again from the end-of-compile
 * callback, to show the answer is a property of the product's execution and
 * not of the moment it is asked.

/* 06 — cbValueChange: how many times it fires, what it carries, and the `index`
 * field for a memory word.
 *
 * LRM 12.31.1: "cbValueChange  After value change on an expression or terminal".
 *
 * LRM 12.31.1: "When a simulation event callback occurs, the user application
 * shall be passed a single argument, which is a pointer to an s_cb_data
 * structure (this is not a pointer to the same structure which was passed to
 * vpi_register_cb()). The time and value information shall be set as directed
 * by the time type and value format fields in the call to vpi_register_cb().
 * The user_data field shall be equivalent to the user_data field passed to
 * vpi_register_cb()."
 *
 * LRM 12.31.1: "For a cbValueChange callback, if the obj is a memory word or a
 * variable array, the value in the s_cb_data structure shall be the value of
 * the memory word or variable select which changed value. The index field shall
 * contain the index of the memory word or variable select which changed value."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * The word is CHANGE, not write, and both halves of that are pinned here.
 *
 * p02_design.n is `reg [3:0]`, so it holds 4'bxxxx until something assigns it.
 * Its complete write history is
 *
 *   t=0  n = 0   xxxx -> 0     a change (an unknown becoming a known IS one)
 *   t=1  n = 5      0 -> 5     a change
 *   t=2  n = 9      5 -> 9     a change
 *   t=3  n = 9      9 -> 9     a WRITE THAT IS NOT A CHANGE — no callback
 *   t=4  n = 2      9 -> 2     a change
 *
 * so a correct implementation delivers EXACTLY FOUR callbacks, at t = 0, 1, 2,
 * 4, carrying 0, 5, 9, 2. Five callbacks means t=3 leaked through; three means
 * the x-to-0 transition at t=0 was not counted. Registration happens from
 * cbStartOfSimulation, which 12.31.4 places at the "beginning of time 0
 * simulation cycle" — before the initial blocks run — so the t=0 transition is
 * inside the callback's lifetime and must be reported.
 *
 * p02_design.mem is `reg [7:0] mem [0:3]`, written
 *
 *   t=0  mem[0]=0x00, mem[1]=0x00, mem[2]=0x00, mem[3]=0x00   (each xx -> 00)
 *   t=1  mem[2]=0x7E
 *
 * = FIVE callbacks, in that order, carrying index 0,1,2,3 then 2, and values
 * 0,0,0,0 then 0x7E = 126. The last one is the interesting one: it is the only
 * place `index` can be wrong without also making the value wrong.
 *
 * TIME AND VALUE DELIVERY. Registered with time->type = vpiSimTime and
 * value->format = vpiIntVal, so 12.31.1's "set as directed by" sentence says
 * each delivered structure must carry those same two tags and the delivered
 * time must equal the tick the change happened at. The timescale is 1ns/1ns, so
 * the tick and the nanosecond are the same number.

/* 04 — vpi_put_value()'s vpiForceFlag / vpiReleaseFlag, and the cbForce /
 * cbRelease callbacks that observe them.
 *
 * LRM 12.30: "vpiForceFlag — The object shall be forced to the passed value
 * with no delay (same as the Verilog-AMS HDL procedural force). Argument time_p
 * shall be ignored and can be set to NULL."
 *
 * LRM 12.30: "vpiReleaseFlag — The object shall be released from a forced value
 * (same as the Verilog-AMS HDL procedural release). Argument time_p shall be
 * ignored and can be set to NULL. The value_p shall contain the current value
 * of the object."
 *
 * LRM 12.31.1: "cbForce/cbRelease  After a force or release has occurred" and
 * "cb_data_p->obj ... For force and release callbacks, if this is set to NULL,
 * every force and release shall generate a callback."
 *
 * LRM 12.31.1: "For cbForce, cbRelease, cbAssign, and cbDeassign callbacks, the
 * object returned in the obj field shall be a handle to the force, release,
 * assign or deassign statement. The value field shall contain the resultant
 * value of the LHS expression. In the case of a release, the value field shall
 * contain the value after the release has occurred."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * The forced object is `w`, an 8-bit net driven by a continuous assignment
 * `assign w = a + 8'd1`. A net, not a reg, deliberately: releasing a reg leaves
 * it holding the forced value until someone assigns it again, so a release test
 * on a reg has no observable destination. Releasing a continuously driven net
 * re-evaluates the driver, and the driver's answer is arithmetic this file can
 * do by hand.
 *
 *   t=0   a = 10  ->  w = 10 + 1 = 11
 *   t=2   application forces w = 0xF0 = 240. The driver still says 11; the
 *         force wins, so w reads 240.
 *   t=6   the design assigns a = 20. The driver now says 20 + 1 = 21, and w is
 *         still forced, so w still reads 240. This is the step that proves the
 *         force actually overrides the driver rather than merely having
 *         happened to match it.
 *   t=10  application releases w. "The value_p shall contain the current value
 *         of the object" — the current value, after the release, is the
 *         driver's: 21. The cbRelease callback sees 21 for the same reason.
 *   t=12  w reads 21, unforced.
 *
 * Callback census: obj == NULL means EVERY force and release is reported, and
 * this application performs exactly one of each and the design performs none,
 * so forces == 1 and releases == 1. A count of 2 would mean the release was
 * also reported as a force, or the single force was reported twice.

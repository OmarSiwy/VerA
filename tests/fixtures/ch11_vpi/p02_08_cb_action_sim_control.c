/* 08 — the simulator ACTION callbacks of LRM 12.31.4, and vpi_sim_control()
 * cutting a run short.
 *
 * LRM 12.31.4: "The following action-related callbacks shall be defined:
 *   cbEndOfCompile        End of simulation data structure compilation or build
 *   cbStartOfSimulation   Start of simulation (beginning of time 0 simulation
 *                         cycle)
 *   cbEndOfSimulation     End of simulation (e.g., $finish system task
 *                         executed)
 *   cbError               Simulation run-time error occurred
 *   cbPLIError            Simulation run-time error occurred in a PLI function
 *                         call
 *   cbTchkViolation       Timing check error occurred"
 * and: "Actions are differentiated from features in that actions shall occur in
 * all VPI-compliant products, whereas features might not exist in all
 * VPI-compliant products." — which is why none of the cbStartOfSave /
 * cbEnterInteractive family is touched here.
 *
 * SIX action reasons; this file registers THREE. That is a scope decision, not
 * a reading of the clause, and the list above is quoted whole so it cannot be
 * mistaken for one:
 *
 *   cbEndOfCompile / cbStartOfSimulation / cbEndOfSimulation are the three a
 *     clean run reaches by existing, so a run that finishes delivers them.
 *   cbError and cbPLIError are reached only by provoking a run-time error, and
 *     an application that provokes one cannot also assert the run was clean —
 *     p02_check.h's expect_no_error would have nothing left to mean. They
 *     belong to a fixture whose subject is error recovery.
 *   cbTchkViolation needs a timing check, hence a specify block. No design in
 *     this row has one and no clause in this row's coverage list reaches them.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this header closed the quotation after
 * cbEndOfSimulation and called them "the three action reasons that shall occur
 * in all VPI-compliant products", which read as though 12.31.4 defined three.
 * It defines six. SPEC.md's "Deliberately NOT covered" now names the other
 * three and what each would need.
 *
 * LRM 12.31.4: "The only fields in the s_cb_data structure which need to be
 * setup for simulation action/feature callbacks are the reason, cb_rtn, and
 * user_data (if desired) fields." So all three registrations below leave `time`
 * and `value` NULL, and an implementation that dereferences them fails here.
 *
 * LRM 12.36: "vpiFinish — cause $finish built-in Verilog system task to be
 * executed upon return of user function. This operation shall be passed one
 * additional diagnostic message level integer argument that is the same as the
 * argument passed to $finish". Return: "1 (true) if successful; 0 (false) on a
 * failure".
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * ORDER. The three registered reasons are defined at three different points of
 * a run's life — after the build, at the head of time 0, and at the end — so a
 * run must deliver them in exactly that order and exactly once each. The
 * application records a three-character order string and asserts "CSE".
 *
 * WHEN. vpi_get_time(NULL) inside cbStartOfSimulation must read 0, because that
 * callback is at the "beginning of time 0". Inside cbEndOfSimulation it must
 * read 12, because that is when this application asked for $finish and 12.36
 * says $finish is "executed upon return of user function" — the same tick, not
 * the next event.
 *
 * WHAT IS CUT OFF. p02_design.g changes at t=0 (xx -> 0x01), 5, 10 and 20, and
 * p02_design prints "p02_design: t=20 reached" at t=20; the design's own
 * backstop $finish is at t=40. This application calls vpi_sim_control(vpiFinish,
 * 0) from a cbAtStartOfSimTime at t=12. A correct implementation therefore
 * delivers EXACTLY THREE cbValueChange callbacks on g — t=0, t=5, t=10 — never
 * reaches t=20, and never prints the design's t=20 line. Four callbacks, or a
 * stdout carrying that line, means the finish was deferred to the design's own
 * t=40 backstop and the request did nothing.
 *
 * The stdout half of that is checked by the harness, not from inside C: this
 * application's only stdout is its own census line, so the expected transcript
 * is exactly one line (see SPEC.md).

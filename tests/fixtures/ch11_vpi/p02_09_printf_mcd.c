/* 09 — vpi_printf() and the multichannel descriptor family.
 *
 * LRM 12.28: "The VPI routine vpi_printf() shall write to both stdout and the
 * current product log file. The format string shall use the same format as the
 * C printf() routine. The routine shall return the number of characters printed
 * or EOF if an error occurred."
 *
 * LRM 12.26: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_open() shall open a file for writing and
 * return a corresponding multichannel descriptor number (mcd). The following
 * channel descriptors are predefined and shall be automatically opened by the
 * system: Descriptor 1 is stdout. Descriptor 2 is stderr. Descriptor 3 is the
 * current log file. The vpi_mcd_open() routine shall return a zero (0) on
 * error. If the file is already opened, vpi_mcd_open() shall return the
 * descriptor number."
 *
 * LRM 12.27: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_printf() shall write to one or more
 * channels (up to 32) determined by the mcd. An mcd of 1 (bit 0 set)
 * corresponds to Channel 1, a mcd of 2 (bit 1 set) corresponds to Channel 2, a
 * mcd of 4 (bit 2 set) corresponds to Channel 3, and so on. ... The routine
 * shall return the number of characters printed or EOF if an error occurred."
 *
 * LRM 12.24: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_close() shall close the file(s) specified
 * by a multichannel descriptor, mcd. ... On success this routine returns a zero
 * (0); on error it returns the mcd value of the unclosed channels. The
 * following descriptors are predefined and can not be closed using
 * vpi_mcd_close(): descriptor 1 is stdout, descriptor 2 is stderr, descriptor 3
 * is the current log file."
 *
 * LRM 12.25: "The VPI routine vpi_mcd_name() shall return the name of a file
 * represented by a single-channel descriptor, cd. On error, the routine shall
 * return NULL. This routine shall overwrite the returned value on subsequent
 * calls."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * CHARACTER COUNTS are straight string lengths of the EXPANDED format:
 *
 *   vpi_printf("p02 printf %d %s\n", 7, "ok")
 *     expands to "p02 printf 7 ok\n" = 16 characters   -> returns 16
 *   vpi_mcd_printf(a, "alpha\n")      = 6 characters   -> returns 6
 *   vpi_mcd_printf(a|b, "both\n")     = 5 characters   -> returns 5
 *
 * DESCRIPTOR NUMBERS. 12.27 fixes the bit mapping (channel N is bit N-1) and
 * 12.26 reserves channels 1, 2 and 3. The first channel an application can be
 * given is therefore channel 4, whose mcd is 1<<3 = 8, and the second is
 * channel 5, mcd 1<<4 = 16. That is a derivation from two sentences rather than
 * one sentence quoted, and it is flagged as such in SPEC.md; what is beyond
 * argument, and is asserted separately below, is that neither descriptor may
 * collide with the reserved 0x7.
 *
 * CLOSING THE RESERVED CHANNELS. vpi_mcd_close(0x7) names channels 1, 2 and 3,
 * all three of which "can not be closed". 12.24 says the failure return is "the
 * mcd value of the unclosed channels", and all three are unclosed, so the
 * return is 0x7 exactly. A return of 0 would be a claim to have closed stdout.
 *
 * FILE CONTENTS. Channel A receives "alpha\n" and then, as part of the two-
 * channel write, "both\n"; channel B receives only "both\n". After both are
 * closed, the files on disk must read exactly "alpha\nboth\n" (11 bytes) and
 * "both\n" (5 bytes). This is the only check that distinguishes "wrote to one
 * of the two channels" from "wrote to both".
 *
 * WHEN. cbEndOfCompile: none of this needs a simulation. The design still runs
 * to completion afterwards, so this application's expected stdout transcript
 * has three lines, listed in SPEC.md.

# Chapter 8 — scheduling semantics

Source: docs/VAMS-LRM/ch8-scheduling.html. Every HTML section id is listed literally. Device dumps cover equations and event metadata; global queues, engine arbitration and time advancement belong to the simulator host.

Parser-boundary disclosure: VerA rejects digital `initial`/`always` module items
before entering their statement bodies. Consequently the blocking-timing,
assign/deassign, force/release, and nonblocking fixtures preserve the normative source
forms but do not validate queue-region semantics. The mixed analog/digital initial-order
fixture likewise cannot test relative execution order after the digital item is rejected.

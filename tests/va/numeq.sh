# Numeric-equivalence oracle: does a codegen change alter what the device COMPUTES?
#
#   tests/va/numeq.sh <old-vera-binary> [model ...]
#
# `tests/va/baseline.sh` compares generated TEXT and `zig build conformance` compares
# diagnostics; neither can see a change that emits different-but-plausible
# arithmetic. This compiles each model through the reference binary and through
# the working tree, links both into one program, and compares residuals BITWISE
# over 2 000 deterministic operating points.
#
# It earns its keep: during the shared-core hoist it caught two
# unsound prunes that 843 conformance fixtures AND the byte oracle both missed —
# an empty block skipped inside a LRM 5.9 loop, and a cached phi clearing the SSA
# join guard. Neither changes any diagnostic and both change the physics.
#
# Getting a reference binary (any commit or any saved tree):
#   zig build-exe -OReleaseFast -Mroot=src/va/main.zig -femit-bin=/tmp/vera-ref
#
# A model that fails to compile under EITHER binary is skipped, not failed —
# `bsim4va` and `hicumL2_va` are expected to fail (see TODO.md), and several
# large models do not link a Debug harness in reasonable time.

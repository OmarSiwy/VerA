/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.34: removing a callback from inside a callback.
 *
 *   12.34  "The VPI routine vpi_remove_cb() shall remove callbacks which were
 *          registered with vpi_register_cb(). The argument to this routine
 *          shall be a handle to the callback object. The routine shall return a
 *          1 (TRUE) if successful, and a 0 (FALSE) on a failure. After
 *          vpi_remove_cb() is called with a handle to the callback, the handle
 *          is no longer valid."
 *   12.31.3  acbConvergenceTest is delivered "Prior acceptance of the analog
 *          solution for the given time"; acbAcceptedPoint "Upon acceptance of
 *          the solution at the given time"; acbAbsTime "shall force a solution
 *          at that time".
 *
 * Three removals, each with an exact expected count, and none of them depending
 * on an ordering the LRM does not fix:
 *
 *  1. REMOVING A FUTURE CALLBACK. Four acbAbsTime callbacks are armed at
 *     1e-3, 2e-3, 3e-3 and 4e-3. An acbAcceptedPoint routine removes the 3e-3
 *     one when it is dispatched at exactly 2e-3. 3e-3 is strictly later, so no
 *     same-instant ordering question arises: the expected counts are
 *
 *         at 1e-3: 1    at 2e-3: 1    at 3e-3: 0    at 4e-3: 1
 *
 *     The zero is the assertion; the three ones are what stops a host from
 *     passing it by dropping every forced point.
 *
 *  2. REMOVING ONESELF DURING ONE'S OWN DISPATCH. The 4e-3 callback calls
 *     vpi_remove_cb() on its own handle and then runs to its `return`. 12.34
 *     invalidates the HANDLE, not the frame, so the routine must complete and
 *     the return value must be 1. Expected: fires exactly once, removal returns
 *     1. A host that frees the callback record underneath the running routine
 *     crashes here, which is the bug this check exists for.
 *
 *  3. REMOVING A CALLBACK FOR THE SAME INSTANT. 12.31.3 ORDERS these two
 *     reasons at one time — "prior acceptance" strictly precedes "upon
 *     acceptance" — so an acbConvergenceTest routine that removes an
 *     acbAcceptedPoint callback at time t suppresses it AT t as well as after.
 *     This is the one same-instant ordering claim the clause actually supports,
 *     and the expected value is exact: after the removal at the first attempt
 *     with t >= 2e-3, the removed routine's largest observed time is strictly
 *     less than that t.

/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.7, 12.8, 12.9: the three no-argument analog queries, at
 * the one point where the standard fixes all three of their values.
 *
 *   12.7  "The VPI routine vpi_get_analog_delta() ... returns the elapsed time
 *          between the latest converged and accepted solution and the solution
 *          being calculated. The function shall return zero (0) during DC or
 *          the time zero transient solution."
 *   12.8  "The VPI routine vpi_get_analog_freq() shall be used determine the
 *          current frequency used in the small-signal analysis. The function
 *          shall return zero (0) during DC or transient analysis."
 *   12.9  "The VPI routine vpi_get_analog_time() shall be used determine the
 *          time of the solution attempted or of the latest converged and
 *          accepted solution otherwise. The function shall return zero (0)
 *          during DC or the time zero transient solution."
 *
 * 12.31.3 names acbInitialStep as the callback delivered "Upon acceptance of
 * the first analog solution". For a transient run started at 0 that solution IS
 * the time zero transient solution, so all three clauses above apply at once
 * and every expected value is a literal zero fixed by the text — no arithmetic,
 * no solver dependence, no tolerance needed beyond exact equality.
 *
 * The negative half matters as much: a plausible wrong implementation returns
 * the FIRST step size from vpi_get_analog_delta() at t = 0 (there is no previous
 * accepted solution to subtract, so the natural bug is to report h), or reports
 * a stale frequency left over from a previous AC analysis. Both are caught here.
 *
 * The fixture also pins the one thing 12.9 says about the rest of the run and
 * that a zero-only test would miss: at a LATER accepted point the routine
 * reports that point's time, not zero — so the zeros above are a property of
 * t = 0 rather than of an unimplemented routine that returns zero always. The
 * second accepted point of any run has t > 0, and delta > 0 there, which is
 * solver-independent.

/* P03 — VAMS-2023 12.13 and 12.6: what was registered can be read back.
 *
 *   12.13  "The VPI routine vpi_get_analog_systf_info() shall return
 *          information about a user-defined analog system task or function
 *          callback in an s_vpi_analog_systf_data structure. The memory for
 *          this structure shall be allocated by the user."
 *   12.6   vpi_get_cb_info() is its counterpart for a callback registered with
 *          vpi_register_cb(): "Pointer to a structure containing callback
 *          information".
 *   12.32  "The task or function name shall be unique in the domain in which it
 *          is registered. That is, the same name can be shared by two sets of
 *          callbacks, provided that one set is registered in the digital domain
 *          and the other is registered in the analog."
 *
 * A round trip is a weak test of a value and a STRONG test of a record: it is
 * the only thing that catches a registration that stored the structure by
 * POINTER and then read a caller's stack frame, or one that kept the fields it
 * happened to need and dropped the rest. Both are the natural first
 * implementation of vpi_register_analog_systf(), and both pass every other
 * fixture in this directory. So every field of Figure 12-18 is written with a
 * distinct value and every field is compared:
 *
 *     type        = vpiAnalogSysFunc   (not vpiAnalogSysTask)
 *     sysfunctype = vpiRealFunc        (not vpiIntFunc)
 *     tfname      = "$p03_probe"       (compared with strcmp, not by pointer:
 *                                       12.12's buffer rule means a returned
 *                                       string may legitimately be a copy)
 *     calltf, compiletf, sizetf, derivtf, user_data — four distinct function
 *                                       pointers and one data pointer, each
 *                                       compared for identity, because an
 *                                       implementation that transposed two of
 *                                       them would otherwise be found only when
 *                                       a solve gave a wrong number.
 *
 * The callback round trip does the same for Figure 12-17, and adds the one
 * assertion that is a VALUE rather than a record: the registered acbAbsTime
 * names t = 2.5e-3, get_cb_info reports 2.5e-3, and the callback is delivered at
 * 2.5e-3 — so the time an application reads back is the time the engine will
 * actually use. Expected: exactly one delivery, at exactly 2.5e-3.
 *
 * 12.32's uniqueness rule closes the fixture: a SECOND analog registration of
 * "$p03_probe" must fail with 12.2's error. Its digital-domain half — the same
 * name registered through vpi_register_systf() must SUCCEED — is P02's routine
 * and is deliberately not asserted here.

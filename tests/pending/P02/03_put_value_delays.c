/* 03 — vpi_put_value()'s six delay modes, its scheduled-event object, and the
 * exact set of events each mode removes.
 *
 * LRM 12.30: "The flags argument shall be used to direct the routine to use one
 * of the following delay modes:
 *
 *   vpiInertialDelay       All scheduled events on the object shall be removed
 *                          before this event is scheduled.
 *   vpiTransportDelay      All events on the object scheduled for times later
 *                          than this event shall be removed (modified transport
 *                          delay).
 *   vpiPureTransportDelay  No events on the object shall be removed (transport
 *                          delay).
 *   vpiNoDelay             The object shall be set to the passed value with no
 *                          delay. Argument time_p shall be ignored and can be
 *                          set to NULL."
 *
 * LRM 12.30: "If the flags argument also has the bit mask vpiReturnEvent,
 * vpi_put_value() shall return a handle of type vpiSchedEvent to the newly
 * scheduled event, provided there is some form of a delay and an event is
 * scheduled. If the bit mask is not used, or if no delay is used, or if an
 * event is not scheduled, the return value shall be NULL."
 *
 * LRM 12.30: "The scheduled event can be tested by calling vpi_get() with the
 * flag vpiScheduled." ... "It shall not be an error to cancel an event which
 * has already occurred." ... "Calling vpi_free_object() on the handle shall
 * free the handle but shall not effect the event."
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * Three 8-bit regs, qi/qt/qp, are set to 0x00 by the design at t=0 and are
 * never touched by the design again, so every transition below is this
 * application's. From cbReadWriteSynch(t=0) — 12.31.2: "cbReadWriteSynch
 * Callback shall occur after execution of events for a specified time", which
 * is where the design's own initialisation has already landed and where
 * writing is still legal — each reg receives the SAME three puts in the SAME
 * order, differing only in the delay mode of the third:
 *
 *   1.  0xAA at +5    vpiPureTransportDelay
 *   2.  0xBB at +20   vpiPureTransportDelay
 *   3.  0xCC at +10   qi: vpiInertialDelay
 *                     qt: vpiTransportDelay
 *                     qp: vpiPureTransportDelay
 *
 * At the moment of put 3 the object's pending set is {0xAA@5, 0xBB@20}.
 *
 *   qp, pure transport: "No events on the object shall be removed" — both
 *       survive. Timeline 0x00, AA@5, CC@10, BB@20.
 *   qt, transport: "All events on the object scheduled for times LATER than
 *       this event shall be removed" — 20 > 10 so BB dies; 5 < 10 so AA lives.
 *       Timeline 0x00, AA@5, CC@10, and CC thereafter.
 *   qi, inertial: "ALL scheduled events on the object shall be removed" — both
 *       AA and BB die, including the one EARLIER than the new event, which is
 *       the only thing separating inertial from transport here.
 *       Timeline 0x00 all the way to CC@10, and CC thereafter.
 *
 * Sampled at t = 5, 10, 20, 27, 30 the hand-computed table is:
 *
 *          t=5    t=10   t=20   t=27   t=30
 *   qi     0x00   0xCC   0xCC   0xCC   (see vpiNoDelay below)
 *   qt     0xAA   0xCC   0xCC   0xCC   0xCC
 *   qp     0xAA   0xCC   0xBB   0xEE   0xEE
 *
 * qp additionally carries the scheduled-event object checks, which need events
 * that outlive their handles:
 *
 *   4.  0xDD at +30, vpiPureTransportDelay|vpiReturnEvent, handle kept and
 *       CANCELLED at t=20 -> DD never lands, so qp is not 0xDD at t=30.
 *   5.  0xEE at +25, vpiPureTransportDelay|vpiReturnEvent, handle FREED at t=0
 *       -> freeing the handle must not unschedule anything, so qp IS 0xEE from
 *       t=25 on. That is why the t=27 and t=30 columns read 0xEE and not 0xBB.
 *
 * Finally vpiNoDelay, applied to qi at t=27: the put takes effect before
 * vpi_get_value() can observe anything else, and — even with vpiReturnEvent
 * ORed in — returns NULL, because "if no delay is used ... the return value
 * shall be NULL". qi therefore reads 0x5A at t=27 after the put and at t=30.

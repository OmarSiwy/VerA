/* 12 — one name, two domains: the uniqueness rule of LRM 12.32, and the '$'
 * rule on tfname.
 *
 * LRM 12.32: "Tasks or functions can be registered with either the analog or
 * digital domain. The registration function (vpi_register_analog_systf() or
 * vpi_register_systf()) with which the task or function is registered shall
 * determine the context or contexts from which the task or function can be
 * invoked and how and when the call backs associated with the function shall be
 * called. THE TASK OR FUNCTION NAME SHALL BE UNIQUE IN THE DOMAIN IN WHICH IT
 * IS REGISTERED. That is, the same name can be shared by two sets of callbacks,
 * provided that one set is registered in the digital domain and the other is
 * registered in the analog." (emphasis added)
 *
 * LRM 12.33, Figure 12-19 and 12.32, Figure 12-18, both on the same field:
 * "char *tfname; /" "* first character shall be "$" *" "/".
 *
 * LRM 12.14 / 12.13: vpi_get_systf_info() and vpi_get_analog_systf_info()
 * "shall return information about a user-defined system task or function
 * callback", into a structure "allocated by the user".
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * The rule has exactly four corners and this file visits all four. `$p02_both`
 * is registered once digitally and once analogically:
 *
 *   vpi_register_systf        ($p02_both)  -> handle D, non-NULL   LEGAL
 *   vpi_register_systf        ($p02_both)  -> NULL + vpiError      duplicate in
 *                                                                  the digital
 *                                                                  domain
 *   vpi_register_analog_systf ($p02_both)  -> handle A, non-NULL   LEGAL: the
 *                                                                  other domain
 *   vpi_register_analog_systf ($p02_both)  -> NULL + vpiError      duplicate in
 *                                                                  the analog
 *                                                                  domain
 *
 * D and A are two different registrations of the same spelling, so
 * vpi_compare_objects(D, A) must be 0 — the LRM's "two sets of callbacks" is
 * two objects, not one object reached two ways, and 12.3 is the only routine
 * that can tell the difference. The two info round trips then show the two sets
 * are genuinely separate: D reports vpiSysFunction / vpiRealFunc and D's own
 * two function pointers, A reports vpiAnalogSysTask and A's.
 *
 * A failed registration must ALSO leave the successful one intact. After the
 * rejected duplicate, vpi_get_systf_info(D) is read again and must still report
 * D's own calltf — a tool that overwrote the entry and then reported failure
 * would pass a check that only looked at the return value.
 *
 * THE '$' RULE. "first character shall be `$`" is a `shall` on the application's
 * side of the interface, so a registration of "p02_nodollar" is a request the
 * implementation must refuse: NULL, with 12.2's error status set, rather than a
 * silently-accepted task no source can ever name. This is the one deliberate
 * refusal check in the P02 set.
 *
 * No design source is read: every assertion here is about the registration
 * table, so this application does its work from vlog_startup_routines and
 * nothing it registers is ever called.

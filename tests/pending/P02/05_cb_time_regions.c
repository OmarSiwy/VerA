/* 05 — the five simulation-time-related callback reasons of LRM 12.31.2, what
 * each of them can see, vpi_get_time()'s two time formats, and 11.6.25's time
 * queue ordering.
 *
 * LRM 12.31.2:
 *   "cbAtStartOfSimTime  Callback shall occur before execution of events in a
 *                        specified time queue. A callback can be set for any
 *                        time, even if no event is present.
 *    cbReadWriteSynch    Callback shall occur after execution of events for a
 *                        specified time.
 *    cbReadOnlySynch     Same as cbReadWriteSynch, except writing values or
 *                        scheduling events before the next scheduled event is
 *                        not allowed.
 *    cbNextSimTime       Callback shall occur before execution of events in the
 *                        next event queue.
 *    cbAfterDelay        Callback shall occur after a specified amount of time,
 *                        before execution of events in a specified time queue.
 *                        A callback can be set for anytime, even if no event is
 *                        present."
 *
 * LRM 12.31.2: "When the cb_data_p->time->type is set to vpiScaledRealTime, the
 * cb_data_p->obj field shall be used as the object for determining the time
 * scaling." and "For reason cbNextSimTime, the time structure is ignored."
 *
 * LRM 12.15: "vpi_get_time() shall retrieve the current simulation time, using
 * the time scale of the object. If obj is NULL, the simulation time is
 * retrieved using the simulation time unit."
 *
 * LRM 11.6.25, NOTE 3: "The time queue objects shall be returned in increasing
 * order of simulation time." and its property list: "Time queue properties:
 * -> time — vpi_get_time()". Its data model: "Callback has one-to-one
 * relationships to expr, prim term, stmt, and time queue (tagged vpiParent)",
 * and NOTE 4: "vpi_iterate() shall return NULL if there is nothing left in the
 * simulation queue."
 *
 * LRM 12.31.4: "cbEndOfSimulation  End of simulation (e.g., $finish system task
 * executed)" — an action reason, and "actions shall occur in all VPI-compliant
 * products", which is why the census below hangs off it.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------ DERIVATION
 *
 * BEFORE versus AFTER. p02_design.s is 0x01 from t=0 and becomes 0x42 in the
 * t=7 queue, and nothing else ever writes it. So the reading of `s` inside a
 * callback at t=7 IS the answer to "which side of the t=7 queue am I on":
 *
 *   cbAtStartOfSimTime(7)  before the queue  ->  s == 0x01
 *   cbAfterDelay(+7 from 0) before the queue ->  s == 0x01
 *   cbReadWriteSynch(7)    after  the queue  ->  s == 0x42
 *   cbReadOnlySynch(7)     after  the queue  ->  s == 0x42, and a write refused
 *
 * A sequence counter additionally pins the only ordering 12.31.2 actually
 * states: both "before" callbacks must run before both "after" callbacks. The
 * relative order WITHIN each pair is not stated by the LRM and is deliberately
 * not asserted here (see SPEC.md).
 *
 * cbAfterDelay's absolute time. It is registered from cbStartOfSimulation,
 * which 12.31.4 defines as "Start of simulation (beginning of time 0 simulation
 * cycle)". A delay of 7 from t=0 is therefore t=7, and s must read 0x01 there,
 * exactly as for cbAtStartOfSimTime(7). If the implementation instead measured
 * the delay from the startup routine or from the first event, this check and
 * the `low == 7` check below would disagree with each other.
 *
 * cbNextSimTime. Registered at t=0, it fires "before execution of events in the
 * NEXT event queue". p02_design's six initial blocks all reach their first
 * delay during t=0, leaving pending design times {1, 5, 6, 7, 40}; this file
 * adds one more of its own at 33 (see TIME QUEUE) and none below 1. The next
 * queue is therefore t=1 either way, and s is still 0x01 there. Asserting the
 * time is what makes this a test — a callback that fired at t=7 would read the
 * same 0x01.
 *
 * TIME FORMATS. `timescale 1ns/1ns everywhere in the P02 set, so the global
 * simulation time unit is 1 ns and 12.15's "simulation time unit" reading of
 * t=7 ns is 7 ticks:
 *
 *   vpi_get_time(NULL, {vpiSimTime})            -> high = 0, low = 7
 *   vpi_get_time(p02_design, {vpiScaledRealTime}) -> real = 7.0
 *     because p02_design's own `timescale unit is also 1 ns: 7 ns / 1 ns = 7.0,
 *     exactly representable, so `== 7.0` is legal without a tolerance.
 *
 * TIME QUEUE. Iterating vpiTimeQueue is done from cbAtStartOfSimTime(2), i.e.
 * before the t=2 queue runs. The set of pending times strictly greater than 2
 * has two sources and BOTH are counted, because 11.6.25's data model puts a
 * callback in a time queue (tagged vpiParent) exactly as it puts an event
 * there, and NOTE 4 speaks of "the simulation queue" without partitioning it:
 *
 *   from the DESIGN   5  the g block's #5
 *                     6  the a block's #6
 *                     7  the s block's #7
 *                    40  the #40 backstop
 *   from THIS FILE   33  a cbAtStartOfSimTime this application registers at a
 *                        time p02_design never visits — legal because 12.31.2
 *                        says of that reason "A callback can be set for any
 *                        time, even if no event is present".
 *
 * so the assertion is: exactly {5, 6, 7, 33, 40}. An earlier revision of this
 * file asserted {5, 6, 7, 40} while registering a callback at t=30; that is a
 * queue this file had itself polluted, and the cheapest way to satisfy it would
 * have been to hide callback wake-ups from vpiTimeQueue — which 11.6.25's
 * vpiParent edge says are exactly what belongs there. The t=30 registration is
 * gone (the census moved to cbEndOfSimulation) and t=33 is now declared,
 * asserted to fire, and asserted to be visible in the walk. Getting rid of the
 * callback-only time altogether would have been the weaker repair: it would
 * leave the one thing 11.6.25 states about callbacks and queues untested.
 *
 * The t=3 step of the n block is NOT in the set: at cbAtStartOfSimTime(2) the
 * t=2 queue has not run, and t=3 is created only when the t=2 event executes.
 *
 * t=999 is asserted ABSENT. The cbNextSimTime registration below passes
 * time->low = 999, and 12.31.2 says "For reason cbNextSimTime, the time
 * structure is ignored" — so it must schedule nothing at 999. Since the walk
 * checks the whole subsequence above 2 for an exact match, a 999 entry fails
 * it, which is the only way this file can observe that the sentence was obeyed
 * rather than merely producing a callback that happened to land at t=1.
 *
 * Whether the CURRENT queue (t=2) is itself returned is left open on purpose:
 * 11.6.25 NOTE 5 qualifies it and the qualification does not have a single
 * reading. Only times strictly greater than the current one are asserted.

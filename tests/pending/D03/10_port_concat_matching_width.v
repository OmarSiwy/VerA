// Verilog-AMS LRM 2.4 §6.5.7.1 *Matching size rule*, in full:
//
//   "A scalar port can be connected to a scalar net and a vector port can be
//    connected to a vector net or concatenated net expression of the matching
//    width. The sizes of the ports and net must match."
//
// plus annex A.4.1 `module_instantiation` for the syntax. This fixture pins the
// HALF of that sentence with observable content: a vector port connected to a
// CONCATENATED NET EXPRESSION of the matching width, on both directions of the
// connection. A port connection is a connection between nets, not an
// assignment, so the concatenation is a bit-for-bit join, leftmost operand
// highest-order, in both directions.
//
// WITHDRAWN CLAIM — this file replaces `10_port_width_conversion.v`, which
// asserted that a port may be connected to an expression of a DIFFERENT width
// (low-order bit to low-order bit, surplus outer bits idle, surplus port bits
// z). The sentence quoted above forbids exactly that: under the shipped
// Verilog-AMS 2.4 document a size mismatch is not a legal connection at all, so
// no conforming implementation owes anyone a value for it. The permissive rule
// lives in IEEE Std 1364-2005 §12.3.6, which is NOT part of the offline
// document set in `docs/` (`grep -ri "low-order bit" docs/` = 0 hits) and which
// §6.5.7.1 narrows. No row owns that claim now. It can come back only if
// (a) 1364-2005 clause 12 is added to `docs/`, AND (b) someone resolves the
// conflict with §6.5.7.1 in favour of the base standard — a fixture cannot
// assume that resolution. See SPEC.md.
//
// NOT asserted here: that a mismatched connection is DIAGNOSED. §6.5.7.1 states
// a constraint on legal source and names no diagnostic, and the inherited
// 1364-2005 §12.3.6 explicitly permits the mismatch with at most a warning.
// Demanding a refusal would pin a rule neither document states.

//
//   u1(q, {h, l})   4-bit input port fed by a 2+2 concatenated net expression:
//     h = 2'b10, l = 2'b01
//     {h, l}  = 4'b1001      (h is the leftmost operand, so bits [3:2])
//     i       = 1001
//     o = i   = 1001 -> q    -> "in_concat 1001"
//
//   u2({oh, ol}, s) 4-bit output port driving a 2+2 concatenated net
//     expression:
//     s  = 4'b1100, so o = 1100
//     oh = o[3:2] = 11, ol = o[1:0] = 00   -> "out_concat 11 00"
//
// Both lines discriminate: an implementation that assembles a port-side
// concatenation in operand order rather than in bit order prints
// "in_concat 0110" and "out_concat 00 11", and one that connects only the first
// operand prints x's or z's in the other half. The two directions are separate
// code paths (receiver vs driver), hence one line each.
//
// BLOCKED: `vera --run` accepts exactly one ordinary module today
// (src/sim/digital.zig, E1100 "digital execution requires exactly one ordinary
// module"), so this fixture needs D07's instance elaboration before it can
// reach the rule it tests.

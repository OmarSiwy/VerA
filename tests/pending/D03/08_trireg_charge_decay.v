// Verilog-AMS LRM 2.4 annex A.2.1.3 `net_declaration`, the trireg alternative:
//   "| trireg [ discipline_identifier ] [ charge_strength ] [ signed ]
//        [ delay3 ] list_of_net_identifiers ;"
// annex A.2.2.2:
//   "charge_strength ::= ( small ) | ( medium ) | ( large )"
// annex A.2.2.3:
//   "delay3 ::= # delay_value
//             | # ( mintypmax_expression [ , mintypmax_expression
//                 [ , mintypmax_expression ] ] )"
// §1.1 makes the meaning IEEE Std 1364 Verilog's: a trireg holds the value it
// was last driven to when all of its drivers go to z (the capacitive state),
// and the THIRD delay of its `delay3` is the charge decay time — the interval
// after which the stored charge is gone and the net becomes x.
//
// The retention half already works (src/sim/digital.zig:785-786 re-reads the
// net's own bit when a driver goes z). The decay half does not exist: today
// the charge is held forever, so a trireg is an unconditional latch. This
// fixture separates the two by SAMPLING AROUND the decay instant.

// t=59/t=61 bracket the decay to exactly t=60 without asserting anything about
// the ordering of events WITHIN t=60. The second half proves the countdown
// restarts, rather than being armed once per net.
//
// Today: this does not parse (`trireg (medium) #(...)`). With the strengths and
// delay accepted but no decay, every line after "driven 1" reads the stored
// value: 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0.

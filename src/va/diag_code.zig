//! Class 0 — the diagnostic code catalogue.
//!
//! One stable identifier per diagnosable condition, plus the LRM citation and
//! the long-form explanation `--explain` prints. This file has NO imports on
//! purpose: it is pure data, so every stage can name a code without pulling in
//! the renderer, and `diag.zig` can import it without a cycle.
//!
//! RULES (read before adding a code)
//!   - Codes are STABLE. Fixtures, docs and user build scripts pin them. A code
//!     is never renumbered and never reused after retirement; retire by leaving
//!     the enum field in place and marking the title `(retired)`.
//!   - The FIRST LETTER carries the severity: `E` = error, `W` = warning.
//!     `diag.severityOf` reads it from `@tagName`, so there is no second table
//!     to keep in sync.
//!   - The NUMBER's leading digits are the engine's stage class, so a code says
//!     which stage owns it:
//!       01xx class 1  lexical + preprocessing      (preprocessor.zig, lexer.zig)
//!       02xx class 2  syntax / annex A             (parser.zig)
//!       03xx class 3  types, disciplines, decls    (lower.zig)
//!       04xx class 4  behavioral semantics         (lower.zig)
//!       05xx class 5  analog operators + math      (lower.zig)
//!       06xx class 6  numerical safety / proof     (proof.zig)
//!       07xx class 7  events + timing              (lower.zig)
//!       08xx class 8  system tasks and functions   (lower.zig)
//!       09xx class 9  hierarchy + elaboration      (lower.zig)
//!       10xx class 10 runtime / artifact contract  (codegen.zig)
//!   - The LRM citation lives HERE, once, not copied into a format string. A
//!     message that still spells "(LRM 3.2.2)" inline is a bug: the renderer
//!     prints `Info.lrm` under every diagnostic already.
//!
//! DOD: `Code` is an `enum(u16)` whose tag name IS the rendered spelling, so
//! `@tagName` replaces a name table. `info` is one exhaustive `switch`, which
//! the compiler turns into a jump table AND — the reason it is a switch and not
//! an array — refuses to compile if a new code arrives without an entry.

/// Static per-code documentation. All three fields are comptime string
/// literals; nothing here is ever allocated.

            \\    `exclude 0` on the divisor's parameter recovers it.

//! Classes 4,5,8,10 — MIR → device.zig. Emits contract-shaped Zig.
//! LRM: §5 behavior (eval/q), §4.5 analog operators (state machine), ch9 system
//! functions, §8.3 device-side simulation contract.
//!
//! Transformation: Mir + Lower + proof.Verdict → device.zig source string.
//!
//! THE INCREMENTAL RULE: emit ONE Zig
//! function per source unit, each with a STABLE name (naming.zig) and the SAME
//! signature, plus a thin dispatcher eval/q. Do NOT emit a monolithic eval and
//! do NOT name values `v{d}` by MIR index — both defeat `zig -fincremental`.
//!
//! DOD: write into one growing output buffer (gpa-owned; every scratch table is
//! on the compilation arena — see `generate`). Determinism is mandatory:
//! identical MIR ⇒ byte-identical output (a no-op edit must reproduce the file).
//!
//! SHAPE OF THE OUTPUT (top-down, so it reads like it is generated):
//!   1. imports + S-generic value-form math helpers                      (§4.3)
//!   2. `U` enum from Lower.node_order (ports first) + `num_ports`  (§1.3.1/§6.5)
//!   3. `Model`  — one field per parameter, spec default                  (§3.4)
//!   4. `Instance` — temperature/abstime/analysis kind + per-operator state (§4.5)
//!   5. one fn per source unit, uniform signature, per-unit @setFloatMode
//!   6. dispatchers `eval` (resistive) and `q` (reactive)                 (§5.6)
//!   7. `initState`/`updateState` advancing stateful operators          (§4.5.2)
//!   8. `comptime { contract.validate(Self); }`
//!
//! CONTROL FLOW. MIR is a CFG; Zig is structured. The reconstruction is the
//! dominator-tree + labelled-block scheme (Ramsey, "Beyond Relooper"): a merge
//! block Y (>1 predecessor) that is an immediate dominator child of X becomes a
//! labelled block opened inside X's emission and closed just before Y's own
//! code, so every edge into Y is `break :B<Y>`; a back edge is `continue :L<X>`
//! on the loop header's `while (true)`. That is exact for every reducible CFG,
//! which is what lowering (structured source) can produce — including `break` /
//! `continue` / inlined-function `return`, which a diamond-matcher would miss.
//! Phis are materialised as function-scope `var`s assigned on each incoming
//! edge (the standard SSA-out-of-form move); an ALIASED phi (ssa.zig's
//! trivial-phi removal) never gets one — every Value is `resolveAlias`d first.

    //
    // 03-codegen.html chose that deliberately ("anonymous shared subexpressions
    // are recomputed, not promoted to hidden shared decls … this keeps every
    // unit independently skippable"). The justification does not hold, and the
    // same document concedes it two paragraphs earlier for NAMED units: "zig's
    // dependency graph dirties consumers correctly when such a unit changes".
    // A shared declaration is therefore BETTER for incrementality, not worse —
    // one declaration to re-analyse instead of 58 copies of it — and the units'
    // own tails stay independently skippable either way.
    //
    // WHY ONE DECLARATION AND NOT ONE PER VALUE. The obvious shape — a function
    // per shared value, calling the functions of its operands — is wrong, and
    // measurably so: the shared values form a DAG, so a value reachable by two
    // paths would be recomputed once per path, and the cost is exponential in
    // the DAG depth. The values have to be computed ONCE and PASSED.
    //
    // WHY *EVERY* TARGET IS IN IT, and not just the ≥K-shared subexpressions.
    // Hoisting a shared region and leaving a per-unit tail behind was measured,
    // and it is the wrong shape twice over:
    //
    //   SIZE. The tails are not tails. `emitCode` walks the whole reachable CFG
    //   for every unit, so each one re-materialises every merge block and every
    //   §5.9 loop whether or not it computes anything in them. On `hisimhv_va`
    //   the 58 tails were 378 634 lines of which 10 830 — 2.86% — were
    //   arithmetic; the median tail was 6 007 lines containing 6 operations.
    //   Folding the targets into the core deletes all of it: 440 124 → 59 986
    //   lines, 23.73 → 3.25 MB. The merged body is the same size as the core
    //   already was (60 061 lines), because the tails carried no information.
    //
    //   RUNTIME. Every tail opened with `const c = core(...)`, so one `eval`
    //   evaluated the core once per contribution — 40 times on `hisimhv_va`,
    //   30 on `vbic13_4t`. LLVM does NOT recover this: built -OReleaseFast it
    //   inlines all 30 `vbic13_4t` tails into the caller and still emits 30
    //   calls to the core (`objdump | grep -c core` = 30), because it cannot
    //   prove a 60 000-line two-pointer function `readonly willreturn`. Merging
    //   is therefore a runtime fix, not a size optimisation: one core per
    //   `eval`, one per `q`.
    //
    // WHAT IS LOST. The per-unit `@setFloatMode` — see `common_mode`. Nothing
    // else: `contract.zig` exposes only `eval`/`q`, and engine.zig (:511, :534,
    // :1216) always evaluates the whole residual, so a unit was never
    // independently callable in the first place.

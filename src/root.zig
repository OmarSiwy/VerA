//! VerA engine — module index & pipeline driver.
//!
//! Each file owns one engine "class" (a group of Verilog-AMS LRM sections).
//! This file is the facade: it re-exports every stage and owns the drivers that
//! sequence them, plus the ownership root (`CompileResult`) that every arena in
//! the engine hangs off.
//!
//! Architecture: a Verilog-A source becomes a loadable device through a
//! fixed, index-based, cache-friendly pipeline. The directories ARE the
//! pipeline — a file's position in it is its position on disk:
//!
//!   .va text
//!  frontend/  → preprocessor.zig  (class 1)  text → text
//!             → lexer.zig/token.zig (class 1) text → tokens (SoA {tag,start})
//!             → parser.zig/ast.zig  (class 2) tokens → AST (SoA, u32 handles)
//!  ir/        → elaborate.zig      (class 9) AST → flat design (§6.2.2)
//!             → lower.zig + ssa.zig → mir.zig (classes 3,4,5,7,9) AST → MIR
//!             → proof.zig          (class 6) MIR → per-unit finiteness verdict
//!  backend/   → codegen.zig+naming (classes 4,5,8,10) MIR → device.zig
//!             → orchestrator.zig  (§8.3 ABI) device.zig → .so (+ GPU kernels)
//!             runtime: eval_batch.zig (§8.3) SIMD device evaluation
//!
//! `frontend/` and `ir/` are shared by all targets; only `backend/` differs. The
//! split exists so a second frontend lowering into this MIR, or a second backend
//! reading it, is a sibling file rather than a rewrite: `ir/` never imports
//! `backend/`, and the compiler enforces that because there is no such import.
//!
//! No file is reachable by neither import graph. The six kernel files
//! (`backend/{filter,str,rng,table,file,limit}_kernels.zig`) reach a device by
//! `@embedFile` rather than by import, so they must stay ADJACENT to codegen —
//! but each is also `@import`ed by a codegen test, which is the whole point of
//! their being real files: what the tests check is byte-for-byte what runs in
//! the device. `filter_kernels.zig` was registered here as the one exception
//! until wave 10 gave `zBilin` its test.
//!
//! That register is THIS block, it is machine-read, and it is EMPTY. An
//! exception is one `//! ORPHAN: <path under src/> — <why>` line here;
//! `tools/source_guards.zig` parses them as the allowlist for its "every
//! `src/backend/*.zig` is reachable from a root" test, and fails the build on a
//! backend file that is neither reachable nor listed. Do not add a line to
//! silence it without the `<why>`: an orphan that stayed silent is how
//! `eval_batch.zig` reached 702 lines nothing could call.
//!
//! DOD ground rules that hold in EVERY file here:
//!   - SoA (MultiArrayList / flat Buf), never array-of-structs across a hot loop.
//!   - Cross-node references are typed `enum(u32)` handles, never pointers.
//!   - Arena ownership per compilation; caller owns allocation.
//!   - Smallest integer that fits; hot/cold field split.
//!
//! OWNERSHIP (the whole engine's rule, enforced here):
//!   Every byte produced by stages 1–5 — preprocessed text, token list, AST,
//!   MIR, Lower side tables — is allocated from ONE per-compilation arena that
//!   `CompileResult` owns. There are two deliberate exceptions, so
//!   `CompileResult.deinit` frees exactly three things:
//!     - `proof.Verdict`, gpa-owned because proof.zig frees its own error
//!       strings;
//!     - `device_zig`, gpa-owned because it is the one unboundedly growing
//!       buffer (182 MB on `hisimhv_va`) and an arena cannot regrow in place —
//!       see `codegen.generate`.
//!   Everything else is the arena.
//!   Diagnostics collect into ONE `diag.Bag` on that same arena and are
//!   gpa-duped at the boundary by `Bag.detach` — a failed compilation frees
//!   its arena on the way out, so a borrowed stage message would dangle.

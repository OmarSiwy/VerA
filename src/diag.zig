//! Class 0 — the diagnostic system: collection, lint levels, provenance, and
//! rendering.
//!
//! Transformation: (stage events) → one `Bag` of `Entry` rows → bytes on a
//! writer, or JSON for a tool.
//!
//! WHY ONE BAG. Before this file every stage owned its own diagnostic struct,
//! its own cap, its own allocator and its own idea of what a source location
//! is (a line, a byte, a token index, a MIR instruction). Five collectors meant
//! five conversion sites in the driver, five chances to drop a location, and no
//! way to sort a parser error and a proof error into source order. There is now
//! ONE collector, one currency (`Span`, a byte range in the preprocessed text),
//! and one renderer.
//!
//! DOD
//!   - TWO POOLS, `string_bytes` and `extra`, exactly as the Zig compiler
//!     stores its own errors (std/zig/ErrorBundle.zig). A diagnostic is a run
//!     of `u32` words in `extra` — its labels and notes trailing it in the
//!     same run — plus NUL-terminated text in `string_bytes`. No per-entry
//!     allocation, no side tables, no pointers to fix up.
//!
//!     WHY THAT FORMAT AND NOT A NICER ONE OF OUR OWN: orchestrator.zig
//!     already receives a real `std.zig.ErrorBundle` from the resident `zig`
//!     child, describing errors in the GENERATED Zig (see `Result.failed`).
//!     Keeping a second, incompatible shape for errors in the Verilog-A meant
//!     two representations of one concept and two ways to serialise them. One
//!     format, one renderer, and a bag is now `{[]u8, []u32}` — memcpy-able
//!     down that same pipe with no bespoke encoding.
//!   - Diagnostics are COLD by construction (capped at 64 per run, written
//!     once, read once). So this file optimises for one thing only: never
//!     paying anything on the path where no diagnostic is produced. The line
//!     index, the dedupe set and the sort all happen lazily, after the first
//!     entry exists.
//!   - Everything the stages allocate lives in the compilation arena. The one
//!     gpa copy happens in `detach`, at the API boundary, because a failed
//!     compilation frees its arena on the way out — and with the pools that
//!     copy is three `appendSlice`s instead of a walk over every string.
//!
//! SEVERITY comes from the code's first letter (`E`/`W`) — see diag_code.zig.
//! There is no second table to desynchronise.
